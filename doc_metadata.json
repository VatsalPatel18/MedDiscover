Diabetes represents one of the most important global health problems. Approximately 90% of diabetics have type 2 diabetes. Identi \ufb01cation of effective screening markers is critical for early treatment and intervention that can delay and/or prevent complications associated with this chronic disease. Fortunately, metabolomics has introduced new insights into the pathology of diabetes as well as to predict disease onset and revealed new biomarkers to improve diagnostics in a range of diseases. Small-molecule metabolites havean important role in biological systems and represent attractive candidates to understand T2D phenotypes.

Introduction Typical civilization diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), represent one of the most signi \ufb01cant global health problems because they are associated with a large economic burden on the health systems of many countries [1]. WHO predicted an estimated future number of 366 million affected individuals in 2030, which would be equivalent toa diabetes prevalence of 5% [2]. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is characterised by high blood glucose levels, which may be due ei- ther to the progressive failure of pancreatic b-cell function and consequently a lack of insulin production or to development of insulin resistance and subsequentl y the loss of b-cell function [3,4].Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2D. Improvement of risk prediction for T2D is crucial to the identi \ufb01cation of high-risk individuals who could bene \ufb01t from targeted preventive measures. Also, the burden of T2D is growing worldwide and a more desperate need for better tools to detect, diagnose and monitor the disease. Gold standard method for identifying patients with T2D is the oral glucose tolerance test [5]. However, this test is not widely used as a risk assessment tool because it is inconvenient, time-consuming, cost and has a poor speci \ufb01city. Fasting plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are more widely used and less expensive, but they donot predict diabetes onset as accurately as an oral glucose tolerance test[6]. An additional shortcoming is its lack of sensitivity, resulting in late disease discovery and consequently the development of compli-cations at the time of diagnosis. To overcome this problem, researchers are hunting for new biomarkers that could be used to diagnose the ear- lier condition and single out individuals who are most likely to bene \ufb01tClinica Chimica Acta 429 (2014) 106 \u2013110 \u204eCorresponding authors.

Therefore, more sensitive markers for early detection of T2D disease are urgently needed, particularly, highly sensitive and speci \ufb01c biomarkers as primary indicators are relatively more useful.

The general procedure in which metabolomics was used for diagnosisand biomarker discovery is shown in Fig. 1 . Metabolomics offers potential advantages that classic diagnose approaches do not, basedon following discovery of a suite clinically relevant biomarker that are simultaneously affected by the T2D [12,13] . It may help in understanding the mechanism of T2D occurrence and progression onthe metabolic level and providing information for the identi \ufb01cation of early marker metabolites for T2D. Thus, in this mini-paper, particularattention will be paid to the past successes in applications of state-of- the-art technology on metabolomics to contribute to low-molecular- weight metabolites discovery in T2D research. 2. Metabolomics technologies Metabolomics has been increasingly applied to diagnosing diseases, measuring the response to treatment, discovering biomarkers, identify- ing perturbed pathways [14 \u201316]. Additionally, metabolomics can be seen as bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype, andidentifying novel changes in speci \ufb01c metabolites. Technological developments are the driving force behind advances in scienti \ufb01c knowledge. There are two major high-throughput tools consisting ofmass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy used in metabolomics study [17]. Both methods enable the comprehensive investigation of metabolic pro \ufb01les and can provide complementary snapshots of the metabolome of body \ufb02uids [18]. Ad- vantages of NMR spectroscopy include the nondestructive natureof the analysis, the robust and reproducible measurements and the minimal preparation requirements, as no separation or ionisation steps are necessary [19]. NMR analysis usually does not require anypretreatment, and enables the identi \ufb01cation of complex unidenti \ufb01ed metabolites [20]. MS is the most frequently used technique in metabolic studies with their high level of sensitivity, and often combined with other suitable methods for the analytical separation of compounds [21,22] . Because no single analytical method can accommodate the chemical diversity of the entire metabolome, therefore, a multiplatform approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding ofmet abolic alterations, and broaden the \u201cwindow \u201dof important metabolic variations [23,24] . 3. Metabolomic features of T2D T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function but currently it is dif \ufb01cult to determine the precise pathophys- iology in T2D patients. Insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells is controlled by complex metabolic and energetic changes provoked by exposure to metabolic fuels. Perturbations in these processes lead to impaired insulin secretion, the ultimate cause of T2D. To increase our understanding of stimulus-secretion coupling and metabolic processes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of T2D, a comprehensive investigation of the metabolic response will be performed [25]. Metabolomics technologies have the potential for providing novelbiomarkers of disease and drug ef \ufb01cacy, and are increasingly being incorporated into biomarker exploration studies [26]. More speci \ufb01cally, metabolomics has a global and non-invasive analysis of biomarkers that are indicators of pathogenic process, or response to therapeutic intervention, thereby helping to monitor treatment response [27].

        "text": "studies [26]. More speci \ufb01cally, metabolomics has a global and non-invasive analysis of biomarkers that are indicators of pathogenic process, or response to therapeutic intervention, thereby helping to monitor treatment response [27]. Recently, panels of multiple biomarkers re \ufb02ecting T2D pathologies have been developed. A variety of biomarkers representing various pathophysiological pathways of insulin resistance, have also been investigated [28]. The number of T2D patients has recently been increasing worldwide. Thus, the discovery of potential T2D biomarkers, leading to the earlydetection and/or prevention of diabetes mellitus, is strongly required. The term biomarker was de \ufb01ned by the National Institutes of Health as a \u201ccharacteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or phar- macologic responses to a therapeutic intervention \u201d. These include lipids, sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, organic acids, and many other low-molecular-weight compounds [29]. These small molecular metabolites could yield important information about a person's health or disease, Fig. 1. The general procedures in metabolomic can be used for biomarker discovery.107 A. Zhang et al. / Clinica Chimica Acta 429 (2014) 106 \u2013110 some of which may be molecular targets for therapeutic intervention [30]. Metabolomics in diabetes has provided researchers much knowl- edge and the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pathwaysand pathophysiological mechanisms. Several potential metabolic bio- markers and related metabolic pathways have been identi \ufb01ed and are currently being investigated and validated in T2D patients, such as 3-hydroxybutyrate with ketogenisis and altered bile acids [31]. Further- more, metabolomics studies conducted on human subjects between di- abetic patients and healthy controls revealed many important altered metabolic pathways and metabolic variations. Metabolomics increased our knowledge of the dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with progression of diseases and provided potentially new therapeutic strategies targeting these dysregulated pathways, though our under- standing about the distinct and complete metabolic footprints of T2D [32]. 4. Bringing metabolomics into T2D research Advantages of metabolomics over other \u201comics \u201d, include its high sensitivity and its ability to enable the analysis of relatively fewmetabolites compared with the unwieldy number of corresponding genes or mRNA molecules. There is mounting evidence that metabolo-mics can provide important insight into biomarker discoveries and the pathogenic nature of various diseases and a great deal of research on diabetes has been conducted with clinical human subjects during the last decade [33,34] . Given that the overall health status of an individual is captured by his or her metabolic state, metabolomics promises toimprove current, single metabolites-based clinical assessments by identifying metabolic signatures that embody global biochemical changes in disease. Metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools are being used to map potential biomarkers for T2D [35]. Application of metabolomics in T2D studies has rapidly evolved during the last decade and provides researchers the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pro \ufb01ling and pathophysiological mechanisms.

Thus, several metabolites were identi \ufb01ed to be related to T2D or insulin resistance and represent the basis for the identi \ufb01cation of novel diabetes biomarkers [36]. The accumulation of information from novel metabolomics technologies comes with substantial hope and expectations that these approaches will yield novel insights into T2D disease processes and that these insights will eventually translate into clinical applications that will pave the way for current medical routine to the ideal of personalized medicine. High-de \ufb01nition MS has been carried out to obtain comprehensive metabolite pro \ufb01ling and pathways of large biological data sets [7]. MS tends to have much higher analytical sensitivity, enables broader surveys of the metabolome, andcan be used to characterize metabolite data either in a targeted or nontargeted manner. Integration of metabolomics-based diagnostic principles into the T2D might be the direction to enable a revolution for future health care, also perhaps it is time to embrace the arrival of \u2018T2D-OMICS \u2019era. 5. Biomarkers and metabolomics studies on T2D Identi \ufb01cation of early biomarkers for prediction and monitoring is needed for adequate screening diagnostics of diabetes. A number of marker metabolites for diagnosis and prognosis of T2D have been reported. Metabolite pro \ufb01les of body \ufb02uids or tissues can be regarded as important indicators of physiological or pathological states, mayprovide a more comprehensive view of mechanisms in disease, and raise the possibility of identifying surrogate markers of T2D. Metabolomic discovery of biomarkers of T2D risk may reveal etiological pathways and help to identify individuals at risk. Floegel et al. had inves- tigated the association between serum metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics in the European cases of T2D [37]. MS used to quantify several metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids,hexose, and phospholipids, in serum samples, signi \ufb01cantly improvedT2D prediction. Surprisingly, metabolomics has revealed that branched- chain amino acids and related metabolites are more strongly associatedwith insulin resistance than many common lipid species [38].T h e branched-chain amino acids-related signature is predictive of incidentT2D and intervention outcomes and uniquely responsive to therapeutic interventions. Of note, Ha et al. reported that the receiver operating characteristic curve estimation suggested that decanoyl carnitine andlysoPC (C14:0) are the best metabolites for predicting the risk of developing T2D [39]. Phospholipids and their metabolisms are closely allied to nosogenesis and aggravation of T2D. Identi \ufb01cation of molecular components of potential biomarkers was performed on ion trap-MS[40]. As a result, 18 compounds with signi \ufb01cant regulation in patients compared with healthy controls were regarded as potential biomarkersfor T2D. Among them, 2 novel biomarkers, i.e., PI C18:0/22:6 and SM dC18:0/20:2, can be used to discriminate healthy individuals and T2D cases. Urinary metabolomes were analyzed to enhance understanding of the metabolic indicators of T2D disease pathogenesis and progression [41]. Urinary compounds signi \ufb01cantly increased in the T2D when compared with the normal group including glycine betaine, citric acid,kynurenic acid, glucose, and pipecolic acid. Wang et al. had"

Urinary compounds signi \ufb01cantly increased in the T2D when compared with the normal group including glycine betaine, citric acid,kynurenic acid, glucose, and pipecolic acid. Wang et al. had investigated whether metabolite pro \ufb01les could predict the development of diabetes [42]. Result showed that a combination of three amino acids couldpredict future diabetes. These \ufb01ndings underscore the potential role of amino acid metabolism in early T2D and suggest that amino acidpro\ufb01les could aid in diabetes risk assessment. A metabolomics approach was used to identify candidate biomarkers of T2D and revealed signi \ufb01cant metabolic variation, such as glycosylated hemoglobin levels, fasting glucose and insulin [43]. Three metabolites (glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine and acetylcarnitine) were identi \ufb01ed and signi \ufb01cantly altered levels and may help in developing novel strategies to prevent T2D. Understanding thebiochemical networks that underlie metabolic homeostasis and how they associate with insulin action will help unravel diabetes etiology. Fiehn et al. had examined differences in plasma concentrations of me- tabolites in fasted obese T2D vs. obese non-diabetic African-American women [44].I tr e \ufb02ects a close link between abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, amino acid catabolism, and ef \ufb01ciency of fuel combustion in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In a study, NMR-based metabolomic analysis in conjunction with multivariate statistics was applied toexamine the urinary metabolic changes in T2D [45]. It demonstrated profound changes in nucleotide metabolism, including that ofN-methylnicotinamide and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, which may provide unique biomarkers for following T2D progression. Suhre et al.\u2019 s study depicts the promising potential of metabolomics in diabetes research by identi \ufb01cation of a series novel and deregulated metabolites that associate with T2D [46]. Key perturbations of metabolic pathways were linked to kidney dysfunction, lipid metabolism, and interaction with the gut micro \ufb02ora (bile acids). Zhao et al. had investigated pathogenesis and pathogenic process of T2D byNMR-based metabonomics [47]. Principal components analysis on urine samples indicates markedly elevated levels of creatine/creatinine,dimethylamine, and acetoacetate, with concomitantly declined levels of citrate, 2-ketoglurarate, lactate, hippurate, and succinate compared with control rats, respectively. In a work, a metabonomic study was performed to determine metabolic variations associated with T2D patients [48]. Signi \ufb01cantly altered serum metabolites in T2D subjects include increased valine, maltose, glutamate, urate, butanoate andlong-chain fatty acid, and decreased glucuronolactone, lysine and lactate. The development of both glucose intolerances and insulin resistances is closely correlated with the progressive changes of human serum metabolome [49]. It provides useful information to bridge the gaps in understanding the metabolic alterations associatedwith the progression of glucose intolerances and insulin resistance status.

Here, Zhang et al. explored the differences in metabolite concentrations between T2D patients and healthy volunteers [12]. Biomarkers re\ufb02ected the biochemical events associated with early stages of T2D. These urinary differential metabolites were identi \ufb01ed involving several key metabolic pathways such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; cysteine and methionine metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis metabolism, etc. It provides new insight into pathophysio- logic mechanisms and may enhance the understanding of its cause of disease. Analyzing metabolic differences between unperturbed and perturbed systems, such as healthy volunteers and patients with a disease, can lead to insights into the underlying pathology [51,52] .I n this review we take a closer look at the metabolomics used within the\ufb01eld of T2D. Furthermore, we highlight the most interesting metabolo- mics publications and discuss these in detail; additional studies arementioned as a reference for the interested reader. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives Metabolomics has the potential to generate novel noninvasive diagnostic tests, based on biomarkers of disease, which are simple and cost effective yet retain high sensitivity and speci \ufb01city characteristics. An early diagnosis of the disease or the identi \ufb01cation of those at risk has the potential of allowing more effective prevention programs and better treatment of the disease. T2D, called the burden of the twenty- \ufb01rst century, is growing with an epidemic rate. There is still a lack of reliable biomarkers indicative of metabolic alterations, highlightingthe need for the development of early diagnostic and prognostic markers for T2D. A deeper understanding of global perturbations in bio- chemical pathways could provide valuable insights about mechanisms of disease, prognostic, and diagnostic biomarkers. High-throughput metabolomics have provided insightful information on T2D disease development and onset prediction, and has revolutionized T2D research. Valuable information regarding T2D development, therapy and diagnosis can now be obtained with microliter sample volumes. Any\ufb01ndings associated with relevance to T2D, once passed to the clinical level, will be eventually combined with other diagnosisapproaches to hopefully reach the 100% detection level for high-risk patients.

Identi\ufb01cation of biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of diabetes and its complications and better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes can facilitate individualized prevention and treatment. With the advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can iden- tify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. Providing information on underlying metabolic pathways, metabolomics can further identify mechanisms of diabetes and its progression. The application of metabolomics in epidemiological studies have identi\ufb01ed novel biomarkers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, such as branched-chain amino acids, metabolites of phenylalanine, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Metabolomics have also been applied to explore the potential pathways modulated by medications. Investigating diabetes using a systems biology approach by integrating metabolomics with other omics data, such as genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data can present a comprehensive metabolic network and facilitate causal inference. In this regard, metabolomics can deepen the molecular understanding, help identify potential therapeutic targets, and improve the pre- vention and management of T2D and its complications. The current review focused on metabolomic biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identi\ufb01ed from epidemiological studies, and will also provide a brief overview on metabolomic investigations for T2D.

        "text": "been projected that 700 million adults will have diabetes worldwide by 2045, with the majority being type 2 diabetes (T2D) [ 1]. Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD); whereby around 40% of individuals with T2D develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) [ 2], and DKD has become the major cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), contributing to half of new cases of ESKD each year [ 3]. Moreover, individuals with T2D have 2- to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death [ 4]. A multinational study including participants from South and East Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, South America, and Europe reported an approximate 50% prevalence of microvascular complications and 30% prevalence of macrovascular complications in T2D [ 5]. DKD characterized by impaired glomerular \ufb01ltration rate or albuminuria has been associated with increased risk of CVD and mortality [ 6,7]. Furthermore, CVD has been estimated to cause two-thirds of Cells 2021 ,10, 2832. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10112832 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 2 of 38 deaths in T2D [ 8]. Consequently, T2D has been ranked fourth among the disease burden worldwide [9], with a 2- to 3-fold increase in medical expenditures [10]. T2D is believed to arise due to complex interactions between genetic information, developmental exposures and environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and pollution [ 11,12]. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark feature of diabetes and has been utilized as a screening and diagnostic biomarker for diabetes, however, metabolic alteration leading to diabetes may be present decades before the onset of hyperglycemia. Modi\ufb01cation of lifestyle (diet and physical activity) could delay or even prevent the development of diabetes [ 13,14], highlighting the utility of powerful screening biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes. Given the increasing risks of adverse outcomes in diabetes and the availability of drugs proven to delay or prevent CVD and DKD [ 15\u201317], it is also critical to identify prognostic biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications or predictive of future diabetic complications, which can facilitate clinicians\u2019 decision making and bene\ufb01t individuals at risk. Biomarkers indicating clinical response to speci\ufb01c medications can help identify individuals who may bene\ufb01t from the therapy compared with those who have no biological response. To improve the prevention and risk strati\ufb01cation of diabetes and its complications, as well as to maximize the bene\ufb01ts from interventions, approaches which provide novel insights into the etiology, diagnosis and prognosis of diabetes are much needed. With the rapid advancements in analytical techniques, it has become possible to identify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner, which has dramatically advanced approaches for biomarker discovery. 2. Metabolomics and Metabolites In 1971, Linus Pauling and colleagues introduced the concept of using quantitative and qualitative patterns of metabolites to understand the physiological status within a biological system [ 18]. Metabolites (with a small molecular mass < 1500 Da) can be endogenous compounds that are produced during endogenous catabolism or anabolism, such as amino acids, peptides, nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, organic acids,"

Metabolites (with a small molecular mass < 1500 Da) can be endogenous compounds that are produced during endogenous catabolism or anabolism, such as amino acids, peptides, nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, organic acids, and fatty acids (FAs), as well as exogenous chemicals, such as toxins and xenobiotics. The metabolome is termed as the complete collection of metabolites in a given biosample. Metabolomics is the method of comprehensively characterizing the metabolome in cells, organs, bio\ufb02uids, or other biological systems. Metabolomics is emerging as an attractive tool for biomarker discovery in diabetes and its complications, since metabolites can provide information on the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of disease. Multiple factors contribute to the development of diabetes. Most genetic variants associated with T2D identi\ufb01ed in large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) only modestly contribute to the risk of diabetes. Among the identi\ufb01ed genetic variants, over 300 common genetic variants collectively explained only 16% of the variance of diabetes in a study which included around one million individuals of European decent [ 19]. Metabo- lites are, in general, the downstream products of gene expression, transcripts, protein transporters, and enzymatic reactions, which are closely correlated with genes in which a single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) base change in a given gene can result in 10,000-fold change in the level of endogenous metabolites [ 20] (Figure 1). Besides internal variations, metabolites can also be affected by exogenous factors, such as diet, lifestyle, physical activities, gut microbiota, and environmental pollution; thus, the metabolome is believed to re\ufb02ect the molecular pro\ufb01le most proximal to an individual\u2019s phenotype, since it integrates information from the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and enzymes as well as exogenous exposures (Figure 1).

The current review focuses on me tabolomic biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identified from epidemiological studies, and will also provide a brief over view on metabolomic biomarkers for T2D identified in pro- spective studies. In the following section, we firstly introduce the analytical methods for metabolic profiling. 3. Analytical Methods 3.1. Untargeted and Targeted Metabolomics There are two analytical approaches for me tabolomics studies: untargeted and tar- geted. Untargeted metabolomics represents the unbiased appr oach to complete profiling of the metabolome, aiming to detect, identify , and quantify as many metabolites in a bio- logical sample as possible. The major strength of untargeted metabolomics is the possibil-ity of uncovering novel biom arkers and pathophysiological pathways of disease. How- ever, the annotation of unknown compounds often becomes a challenge, given the wide coverage of signals. In contrast, targeted me tabolomics aims to meas ure a prespecified set or cluster of chemical compounds, which ar e usually lying on the same metabolic path- ways or are structurally similar. Although only capable of provid ing limited information on the metabolic profiling, targeted metabolomics in general has higher sensitivity and selectivity, and can often provide a deeper understanding of the selected metabolites. 3.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy In sharp contrast to the genome, which comprises of only four nucleotide bases, or the proteome, which represents the different co mbinations of 20 proteogenic amino acids, the metabolome consists of chemical comp ounds belonging to thousands of different chemical classes [22] (Figure 1).

Given the diverse chemical properties and the wide Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 4 of 38 range of concentrations of metabolites, currently, no single platform can quantify the entire metabolome. The two most commonly used techniques are NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), with the latter usually coupled to separation techniques, such as gas chromatography (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography (LC-MS). NMR works by the manipulation of the nuclear spin of certain atomic nuclei, such as1H,13C,15N, and31P , by exposing them to a strong external magnetic \ufb01eld, and then recording the frequency of electromagnetic radiation released as a result of nuclei relaxation.

Because the signal of a given nucleus is in\ufb02uenced by the neighboring atoms in a predictable way, the chemical shifts in its resonance frequency can thus be used to identify the underlying molecular structure. Since1H atoms can be found in most of the organic compounds, proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy (1H NMR) is widely employed in NMR-based metabolomics studies. NMR is noninvasive and nondestructive, and requires little or no sample preparation, chromatographic separation, or chemical derivatization; it can also be applied to in vivo tissues or to living samples, such as the real-time pro\ufb01ling of living cells and analysis of real-time metabolic \ufb02ux [ 23,24]. Another advantage of NMR is that NMR is especially suitable for assessing protein-bound metabolites (i.e., lipoprotein particles), and given the high automatability and reproducibility, NMR can be applied in large-scale metabolomics studies [ 25,26]. The major limitation of NMR, however, is its relatively low sensitivity (millimole to micromole per liter range), which is approximately 10 to 100 times less sensitive than MS. 3.3. Mass Spectrometry The high resolution and sensitivity of MS has made it the most widely used platform for metabolomic studies [ 27]. Compounds are \ufb01rst separated by chromatographic tech- niques (i.e., GC or LC) to reduce ion suppression, before quanti\ufb01cation and identi\ufb01cation by the mass spectrometer. GC-MS is a highly sensitive and suitable method for the separa- tion of volatile and thermally stable metabolites. GC-MS can separate naturally volatile compounds, such as ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and furans, and compounds that can be made volatile by derivatization, such as sugars, amino acids, lipids, and or- ganic acids [ 28]. As chemical derivatization may alter the structure of compounds and unpredictable variations may occur during sample preparation, one of the drawbacks of GC-MS is its relatively low reproducibility [ 29]. Compared with GC-MS, LC-MS requires higher instrument costs, and suffers from lower reproducibility. LC-MS can separate a wide range of classes of compounds, from very polar to very nonpolar ones [ 30]. As compounds in bio\ufb02uids must be ionized prior to MS measurement, unlike GC-MS which utilizes the hard-ionization approach (i.e., electron-impact [EI] ionization), LC-MS often uses soft-ionization methods instead (i.e., electrospray ionization [ESI] and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization [APCI]), thus generating ions without fragmentation and allowing the identi\ufb01cation of unknown compounds [ 31,32]. Compared to GC-MS, one of the advantages of LC-MS is that chemical derivatization is not required in most conditions since high temperatures and volatility are no longer required. Moreover, LC-MS is in general more sensitive, covering compounds from low molecular weight to molecular weights beyond 600 Da, including phospholipids, conjugated bile acids, glycosides and sugars [ 33]. However, the major drawback of LC-MS as an untargeted platform is the lack of transferable mass"

Metabolomics in Diabetes The characteristic perturbations of metabolic homeostasis associated with or preceding the development of hyperglycemia makes metabolomics a good method to elucidate the potential pathways and to explore potential biomarkers for T2D. Over the past two decades, metabolomics has been widely utilized in large epidemiological studies, and some metabolites/pathways have been identi\ufb01ed and validated to be associated with insulin metabolism or being predictive of diabetes across different studies [ 35]. Table 2 summarizes the \ufb01ndings from some of key prospective studies [36\u201366]. Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 6 of 38 Table 2.

Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs) BCAAs (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) have been found to be altered among obese vs. lean humans, and were found to contribute to insulin resistance in experimental studies [ 67]. First reported in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and subsequently replicated in the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer study [ 38], BCAAs and two aromatic amino acids (AAAs, tyrosine and phenylalanine) were found to be associated with increased risk of T2D during a 12-year follow-up, and the associations remained signi\ufb01cant after adjustment for age, sex, body-mass index (BMI), and fasting glucose [ 38]. The combination of three amino acids (isoleucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) could predict T2D (odds ratio [OR] 2.42, 95% con\ufb01dence interval [CI] 1.66\u20133.54). Furthermore, compared to individuals from the lowest quartile, people in the highest quartile had an odds ratio of 5.99 (95% CI,2.34\u201315.34 ) for diabetes [ 38]. Multiple studies across different ethnicities have since replicated the association between BCAAs and risk of diabetes [ 39,45,47,51\u201354,57,59,60]. BCAAs have been found to be related to insulin resistance in animal and human studies [ 68], however, it remains unclear whether BCAAs contribute to diabetes in a causal manner.

Using genetic variants mimicking the life-time effects of an environmental exposure which are \ufb01xed at conception as the instrumental variable, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have been utilized to explore the potential causal link between exposures and outcomes. One MR study found that a GRS (genetic risk score) for insulin resistance causally increased BCAAs levels, while genetically increased BCAAs were not associated with insulin resistance [ 69]. Another two-sample MR study further supported a causal link between insulin resistance and BCAAs [ 70]. Despite lacking a direct causal link with diabetes, these results suggest that BCAAs may lie on the causal pathway from insulin resistance to diabetes by mediating the effect of insulin resistance on the development of diabetes, since BCAAs levels have been found to be increased by obese microbiomes, and there is decreased oxidation in the adipose tissue and liver in people with insulin resistance [ 71] (Figure 2). BCAAs may therefore serve as predictive biomarkers, especially given their levels may be increased as early as a decade before overt diabetes. Cells 2021 , 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 41 4.1.

The combination of three amino acids (isoleucine, tyrosine, and phenylalanin e) could predict T2D (odds ratio [OR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.66\u20133.54). Furt hermore, compared to individuals from the lowest quartile, people in the highest quartile had an odds ratio of 5.99 (95% CI, 2.34\u2013 15.34) for diabetes [38]. Multiple studies acro ss different ethnicities have since replicated the association between BCAAs and risk of diabetes [39,45,47,51\u201354,57,59,60]. BCAAs have been found to be related to insulin resistance in animal and human studies [68], however, it remains unclear whether BCAAs co ntribute to diabetes in a causal manner. Residual confounding and reverse causation in observational studies often hamper the causal inference between biomarkers and outcomes. Using genetic variants mimicking the life-time effects of an environmental exposure which are fixed at conception as the instru- mental variable, Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have been utilized to explore the potential causal link between exposures and outcomes. One MR study found that a GRS (genetic risk score) for insulin resistance causally increased BCAAs levels, while genet- ically increased BCAAs were not associated with insulin resistance [69].

One MR study found that a GRS (genetic risk score) for insulin resistance causally increased BCAAs levels, while genet- ically increased BCAAs were not associated with insulin resistance [69]. Another two- sample MR study further supported a causal link between insulin resistance and BCAAs [70]. Despite lacking a direct causal link with diabetes, these results suggest that BCAAs may lie on the causal pathway from insulin resi stance to diabetes by mediating the effect of insulin resistance on the development of diabetes, since BCAAs levels have been found to be increased by obese microbiomes, and there is decreased oxidation in the adipose tissue and liver in people with insulin resi stance [71] (Figure 2). BCAAs may therefore serve as predictive biomarkers, especially given their levels may be increased as early as a decade before overt diabetes. Figure 2. The role of BCAAs in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. In mendelian randomization studies, genetically predicted insulin re sistance increased BCAAs, ra ther than the reverse. BC AAs oxidation in adipose tissue and liver was decreased in people with insulin re sistance, leading to elevated circulating BCAAs. Obese Figure 2. The role of BCAAs in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. In mendelian randomization studies, genetically predicted insulin resistance increased BCAAs, rather than the reverse. BCAAs oxidation in adipose tissue and liver was decreased in people with insulin resistance, leading to elevated circulating BCAAs. Obese microbiomes could elevate BCAAs. One of the BCAAs, leucine, could activate the mTOR pathway. The above \ufb01ndings suggest a potential mediating role of BCAAs in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Increased BCAAs oxidation in skeletal muscle depletes the intracellular pool of glycine and increases 3-hydroxyisobutyrate production, resulting in skeletal muscle lipotoxicity, which may be the mechanism linking BCAAs and insulin resistance.

Aromatic Amino Acids Tyrosine and phenylalanine, two kinds of AAAs, have also been associated with risk of diabetes [ 38,39,45,47,49,54,56,59,60]. Analyses in individuals with normal fasting glucose from the FHS found a positive association between phenylalanine and future diabetes, and the consistent \ufb01ndings in MR studies further supported a potential causal role of phenylalanine in the pathogenesis of diabetes [ 58]. A breakdown product of phenylalanine, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate, has been found to be associated with decreased insulin secretion and diabetes in the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study [ 63]. Results from the Southall Additionally, Brent Revisited (SABRE) study suggested a stronger association of tyrosine with diabetes in South Asians than in Europeans, indicating that the metabolic pro\ufb01le may differ between different ethnicities, and that metabolites may be helpful towards exploring ethnic differences in diabetes incidence. Tyrosine may be an ideal predictive biomarker for diabetes in South Asians [45]. 4.1.3. Other Amino Acids Glycine, a nonessential amino acid [ 72], was found to be inversely associated"

Tyrosine may be an ideal predictive biomarker for diabetes in South Asians [45]. 4.1.3. Other Amino Acids Glycine, a nonessential amino acid [ 72], was found to be inversely associated with diabetes in Europeans [ 40,42,47,58], whereas a positive association has been reported in a Chinese population [ 51]. The MR analysis from the FHS suggested a potential causal link between glycine and diabetes, with the genetically predicted glycine being inversely associated with risk of diabetes [ 58]. However, a study including 74,124 T2D cases and 824,006 controls did not \ufb01nd an association between genetically predicted glycine and diabetes risk [ 73]. Furthermore, the study found that genetically higher insulin resistance was associated with lower levels of glycine, suggesting a mediating role of glycine between insulin resistance and diabetes [ 73]. Alanine, a nonessential amino acid synthesized from pyruvate and BCAAs, has also been reported to be associated with diabetes [ 39,47,49,54,56]. Glutamate, synthesized from -ketoglutaric acid in the citric acid cycle, has been found to be associated with the risk of diabetes [ 47,52,60] and a reverse association of glutamine, a transamination product of glutamate, has been reported [ 39,52]. The biological roles of these amino acids in the development of diabetes are, however, yet to be elucidated. 4.2. Organic Acids Alpha-hydroxybutyrate, a product of threonine and methionine, upstream of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, has been associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [ 41,50,52,53,63]. Ketone bodies are an important alternative energy source during fasting, and levels of ketone bodies represent the balance of production (ketogenesis) and utilization (ketolysis). Acetoacetate, converted from free fatty acids (FFAs), has been associated with impaired insulin secretion and diabetes [43]. 4.3. Lipids 4.3.1. Lipoproteins Individuals with T2D commonly exhibit dyslipidemia, namely, high levels of triglyc- erides and small dense LDL particles, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles- terol, and normal or near-normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels [ 74]. NMR has emerged as a novel method to measure lipoprotein particles [ 75], and has been applied in investigations on lipoproteins and onset of diabetes. In the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) size and small HDL were associated with increased risk of diabetes, independent of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol in prediabetic subjects [ 36]. In the Women\u2019s Health Study (WHS), both lipopro- tein particle size and concentration have been associated with incident diabetes during 13-year follow-up; VLDL size, total/large/small VLDL concentration, and small LDL and HDL were positively associated with diabetes, while large LDL and HDL were inversely associated [ 37]. Analyses from Finnish populations have also found a positive association for VLDL and a negative association for HDL [ 46,59]. Recent analyses from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study with detailed HDL subspecies Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 14 of 38 measurements reported heterogeneous associations between HDL subclasses and inci- dent diabetes: larger HDL size"

Fatty Acids FFAs are produced during hydrolysis of triglycerides [ 76]. Under the insulin-resistant state, increased lipolysis leads to overproduction of FFAs. In the METSIM study, saturated FAs were associated with increased risk of diabetes, while an inverse association has been found between unsaturated FAs and diabetes [ 44]. Furthermore, monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs%) were associated with risk of diabetes in a prospective study combining four Finnish cohorts over 8\u201315 years of follow-up, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs%), mainly n-6 FAs, were associated with decreased risk of diabetes [ 59]. A two-sample MR study suggested potential causal associations between FAs and fasting glucose, beta cell function, and diabetes [ 77]. Genetically predicted linoleic acid, the main n-6 PUFAs, has been consis- tently associated with lower risk of diabetes in a two-sample MR using different genetic variants and analytical approaches [ 78]. FAs can be derived from dietary triglycerides and phospholipids and dietary counselling has been shown to modify circulating FAs levels [ 79]. With possible causal links with diabetes, FAs may be emerging as new intervention targets for the prevention of diabetes. 5. Metabolomics in Diabetic Kidney Disease The kidneys are metabolically active organs involved in modulating the circulating levels of metabolites through \ufb01ltration, reabsorption, secretion, and metabolism (including catabolism and anabolism). Consequently, changes in metabolite concentrations may re\ufb02ect kidney function, and these changes may even precede the onset or progression of kidney disease, hence providing insights into the development and progression of DKD. Creatinine is one of the commonly applied metabolites that is freely \ufb01ltered at the glomerulus, and not reabsorbed, with only limited secretion by tubules [ 80]. Serum creatinine can be used to estimate glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) noninvasively, however, creatinine is signi\ufb01cantly increased at more advanced stages of CKD (CKD stage three and onward) and is affected by age, sex, race, and muscle mass. The identi\ufb01cation of early markers is warranted given the availability of treatments which can prevent and delay DKD progression. Metabolomic studies have been applied to investigate blood or urine metabolomic biomarkers for DKD and have provided novel insights into the mechanisms leading to DKD and its progression, which make potential therapeutic targets possible.

Analyses from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modi\ufb01ed Release Controlled Eval- uation (ADVANCE) trial found a crude association of phenylalanine with macrovascular disease and all-cause mortality in T2D, however, adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the associations, and phenylalanine was not associated with microvascular disease prospectively [ 95]. Tyrosine is synthetized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine through phenylalanine hydroxylase. In the setting of CKD, dysfunctional activity of pheny- lalanine hydroxylase leads to impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, resulting in higher phenylalanine and lower tyrosine [ 109]. In contrast to phenylalanine, tyrosine has been both cross-sectionally [ 106] and prospectively [ 93,95] associated with DKD. A higher level of tyrosine has been associated with higher baseline eGFR [ 106] and lower risk of microvascular disease in ADVANCE [ 95].

The downstream metabolite of tyrosine (o-sulfotyrosine) has been positively associated with ESKD in a Joslin proteinuria cohort including patients with T1D, proteinuria and stage three CKD [93]. 5.1.3. Other Amino Acids Leucine and isoleucine have been inversely associated with baseline eGFR in patients with T2D using NMR [ 106]. However, a study from Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen using GC-MS found that BCAAs were associated with lower risk of a combined endpoint (kidney dysfunction or all-cause mortality) in patients with T1D [ 99]. A study from ADVANCE also found that leucine and valine were inversely associated with all-cause mortality in patients with T2D, while alanine, synthesized from BCAAs, was inversely associated with microvascular disease, indicating the complex interactions between BCAAs and diabetes and its complications [ 95]. Threonine, an essential amino acid involved in the production of glycine, has been associated with lower risk of rapid eGFR decline in patients with T1D [ 102], and the downstream metabolite of threonine (n-acetylthreonine) was predictive of fast eGFR decline in patients with T2D [ 91] and ESKD in patients with T1D [93]. 5.1.4. Organic Acids Involved in Energy Metabolism Uracil, a pyrimidine derivative, was altered in urine samples from patients with DKD [ 85,92]. Pseudouridine, synthesized from uracil, showed association with eGFR decline and urinary albumin\u2013creatinine ratio (UACR) increase in patients with T2D [ 91] and ESKD in patients with T1D or T2D from studies in Joslin [ 88,93]. 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, a catabolic intermediate of valine which is produced in mitochondria, has been shown to be altered in patients with DKD [ 85] and has been found to be associated with ESKD in patients with diabetes in the Chronic Renal Insuf\ufb01ciency Cohort (CRIC) Study [ 105]. Alpha-hydroxybutyrate, positively associated with insulin resistance and diabetes as men- tioned above, however, has been found to be associated with lower risk of ESKD in patients with T2D [ 88]. Glycine has been found to be reduced in urine samples from patients with established DKD [ 92], and glycolic acid, an intermediate of glycine, was also re- duced [ 85,92] and was associated with ESKD in analyses from CRIC [ 105]. Acetoacetate has also been inversely associated with baseline eGFR in patients with T2D [ 106], and 2-methylacetoacetate, an intermediate of isoleucine metabolism, was reduced in urine from patients with DKD [ 85]. The abovementioned metabolites are all produced in the mito- chondria and are involved in energy metabolism, suggesting that mitochondrial function is dysregulated in DKD. 5.2. Lipids 5.2.1.

A two-sample MR study using the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium ( n= 188,577) and the CKD Genetics Consortium ( n= 133,814) suggested a causal link between HDL cholesterol and better kidney function: genetically increased HDL cholesterol was associated with 0.8% higher eGFR and lower risk of incident CKD, and this \ufb01nding was robust in all the sensitivity analyses; however, there was no strong evidence supporting causal associations of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with baseline eGFR/UACR or incident CKD [110]. 5.2.2. Phospholipids Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the two most abun- dant phospholipids of mammalian cell types, comprising 40\u201350% and 15\u201325% of the total cellular phospholipids, respectively [ 111]. A case\u2013control study found lower plasma levels of PCs metabolites in patients with T2D and overt DKD (macroalbuminuria or CKD), and this \ufb01nding was replicated in another group of patients [ 90]. A prospective analysis from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) also found that serum PCs were predictive of incident CKD in hyperglycemic patients, independent of conventional risk factors [ 104]. Unsaturated PEs have been found to be distinguishable between progressors ( \u001540% eGFR reduction) and nonprogressors in patients with T2D and baseline eGFR \u001590 mL/min/1.73 m2[98]. Sphingolipids are also important constituents of cell membranes and have been involved in cell signaling and activation. Ceramides, the essential precursors of sphingolipids, and sphingomyelin, the most common sphingolipids, were altered in patients with DKD. Higher plasma levels of ceramide metabolites have been reported in patients with DKD [ 90]; studies from the Diabetes Control and Compli- cations Trial (DCCT) study found that higher plasma levels of very-long-chain ceramides were associated with incident macroalbuminuria in patients with T1D during 14\u201320 years of follow-up [ 87]. Sphingomyelin level has been found to be elevated in patients with DKD [ 84] and was associated with incident CKD in hyperglycemic patients [ 104] and progression of DKD in patients with T1D [107]. 5.2.3. Fatty Acids and Acylcarnitines Apart from the link between insulin resistance and diabetes, FFAs have also been found to be predictive of DKD progression. Among patients with T2D and baseline eGFR \u001590 mL/min/1.73 m2, unsaturated FFAs were associated with lower risk of \u001540% eGFR reduction during follow-up [ 98]. Although associated with macrovascular events and death, FAs were however, not associated with microvascular events or onset or worsening of nephropathy in the ADVANCE trial [ 112]. Acylcarnitines, involved in the -oxidation of FAs in the mitochondria and barely detectable in nonpathological conditions, have also been found to be elevated in DKD [ 90].

C16-acylcarnitine was a strong predictor of fast eGFR decline in patients with T2D and CKD at baseline, independent of traditional risk factors [ 89]. Disturbed lipid metabolism (remodeling of sphingolipid or impaired -oxidation of FAs) indicates once again the perturbation of energy metabolism and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of DKD. 5.3. Sodium\u2013Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i) SGLT2i reduced the risk of albuminuria and progression of DKD in patients with T2D in multiple clinical trials [ 15,113,114], however, its underlying effective pathways remain unclear. Metabolomics have been applied to explore potential molecular mechanisms mediating the protective effects of SGLT2i on DKD. Dapagli\ufb02ozin has been suggested to improve mitochondrial function. Levels of a panel of urinary metabolites previously linked to mitochondrial dysfunction were increased after 6-week of treatment using GC- MS [ 115]. A study combining metabolomics (plasma) and transcriptomics (kidney biopsy) found three pathways linked with energy metabolism or mitochondrial function have been affected by dapagli\ufb02ozin, namely, glycine degradation (mitochondrial function), Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 24 of 38 tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) II (energy metabolism), and L-carnitine biosynthesis (energy metabolism) [ 116]. The improvement of mitochondrial function by SGLT2i as the underlying mechanism to delay the development and progression of DKD further supports the observation that mitochondria play a role in DKD. 5.4. Current Challenges in Metabolomics Studies in DKD The kidney itself can modulate the metabolic pathways, which as a result, affects the levels of circulating metabolites. Furthermore, the de\ufb01nition of CKD in most of the current studies is based on eGFR rather than the measured glomerular \ufb01ltration rate, while eGFR is insuf\ufb01cient to re\ufb02ect early kidney dysfunction. Although changes in metabolites may precede the onset or progression of DKD, they may be resulted from early DKD which is not re\ufb02ected by clinical manifestations or the surrogate markers (i.e., eGFR). For example, tyrosine is positively associated with baseline eGFR [ 106], as improved kidney function induces increased production of tyrosine from phenylalanine [ 109]. Tyrosine and its downstream metabolites are also predictive of onset or worsening of nephropathy [ 95] and ESKD [ 93], which may be due to the link between tyrosine and kidney function, that tyrosine metabolism as a re\ufb02ection of kidney function can predict renal outcomes rather than being a physiological pathway. The complex interplay between the kidney and metabolites makes causal inference dif\ufb01cult. However, some metabolites are predictive of DKD independent of baseline eGFR and albuminuria, highlighting their value as prognostic biomarkers. Moreover, the lack of large, prospective cohort studies and independent replications limit the interpretations of these observations and clinical utility of potential biomarkers. 6.

Metabolomics in Cardiovascular Disease The heart is responsible for around 10% of the fuel consumption of whole body [ 117] and beats around 2.5 to 4 billion times over an average human life, even though myocardial energy stores are only enough for several heart beats [ 118]. To meet these high energy need, the heart consumes more than 20 g of carbohydrates and 30 g of fat per day and uses 35 L of oxygen to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [ 117]. The metabolism in the heart is highly \ufb02exible, such that it can alter the energy utilization rapidly to adapt to the changes in environment via using different kinds of energy substrates, including glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies, and amino acids [ 119]. The perturbations of metabolism in the heart can usually be re\ufb02ected by the changes in the involved circulating metabolites. Detection and quanti\ufb01cation of these metabolites provide a way to investigate the under- lying pathogenic mechanisms of CVD. Moreover, some of the metabolites have potential to be biomarkers (i.e., screening, diagnostic, or prognostic biomarkers). Metabolomics have been comprehensively applied in studying CVD in the general population and CVD cohorts [ 119,120].Table 4 summarizes metabolomics studies in CVD in people with dia- betes [95,107,112,121\u2013127].

ADMA ADMA has been found to be elevated in patients with CVD and associated with higher odds of CVD in a cross-sectional study of patients with T2D [ 122]. ADMA was also predictive of cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with T2D [ 124] and patients with T1D and DKD [ 123]. Higher risks of faster eGFR decline and ESKD in patients with higher ADMA [ 123] suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a shared mechanism responsible for vascular complications (cardiorenal complications) in diabetes. 6.1.2. Other Amino Acids Besides the link with diabetes, BCAAs, tyrosine, and phenylalanine have been found to be associated with intima-media thickness and incident CVD in population-based stud- ies [128\u2013130]. Higher phenylalanine was associated with risk of macrovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, sex, region, and randomized treatment in the ADVANCE trial, however, further adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the association [ 95].

Glutamine and histidine, inversely associated with dia- betes [ 39,52], were also inversely associated with macrovascular outcomes in ADVANCE, although adjustment for risk factors attenuated the associations [ 95]. Although negatively associated with kidney function [ 106], phenylalanine has been associated with higher risk of incident heart failure and showed added value on the risk-strati\ufb01cation of heart failure [ 131]. A CVD index composed of six amino acids (ethanolamine, hydroxyproline, glutamic acid, 3-methylhistidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) was predictive of CVD [ 125]. The altered levels of amino acids in diabetes, DKD and CVD might suggest some shared pathways or mechanisms leading to diabetes and its complications. 6.2. Lipids 6.2.1. HDL Despite the inverse association between HDL cholesterol and risk of CVD in epi- demiological studies, MR studies and randomized clinical trials to raise HDL cholesterol level failed to \ufb01nd a protective effect of HDL cholesterol on CVD [ 132\u2013139]. HDL parti- cles are highly heterogeneous in size, structure, composition, and function [ 140]. Recent structural and functional studies suggested that the biological function of HDL particles differed in size with small, dense, and protein-rich HDL particles involved in the \ufb01rst step of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by mediating the effect of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) [ 141,142]. Besides mediating RCT from macrophages, small HDL particles also have anti-in\ufb02ammatory, antioxidant, and endothelial protective functions (Figure 4) [143\u2013146] . In line with this, small HDL particles have been found to be inversely associated with CVD, stroke, CV death, or all-cause mortality in some well-established studies [ 147\u2013154]. Nevertheless, contrasting \ufb01ndings have also been reported [ 155,156]. There seems to be a bidirectional relationship between T2D and HDL whereby diabetes could also modulate the composition and function of HDL [ 157]. Concentration of large HDL particle and HDL particle size have been found to be increased in patients with T1D compared with participants without diabetes, while small HDL and total HDL par- ticle concentration were reduced [ 158]. A nested case\u2013control study from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study found that HDL particle subclasses were predictive of incident coronary artery disease in patients with T1D [ 121]. Large HDL parti- cle size was associated with risk of death in the Catheterization Genetics (CATHGEN) study and a positive association has been found between higher large HDL particle concentration and death in patients with preserved-ejection-fraction heart failure and patients without heart failure, even after stringent Bonferroni correction and comprehensive adjustment including HDL cholesterol [ 147]. A nested case\u2013control study from the Prevenci \u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr \u00e1nea (PREDIMED) cohort measured HDL functional characteristics and found that lower levels of HDL function markers were associated with higher odds of acute coronary syndrome independent of HDL cholesterol in patients at high CV risk [ 159].

Addition of the metabolite score over a model including the above- mentioned predictors improved the discrimination and reclassi\ufb01cation, with signi\ufb01cantly Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 29 of 38 improved integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassi\ufb01cation improvement (NRI), though the increase in c-statistic was modest and not signi\ufb01cant (0.012, p= 0.13) [ 59]. Despite being predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with diabetes, most of the metabolites (sphingomyelin, amino acids and FAs) failed to increase the c-statistic on top of established risk factors [ 95,107,112]. As demonstrated by Wang and colleagues, the key determinant of the predictive value of multiple biomarkers was the degree of correlation between biomarkers [ 161,162]. To improve the c-statistic by 0.05, more than 50 moderately correlated (r = 0.4) biomarkers were needed; while when the biomarkers were weakly correlated (r = 0.05), less than 10 biomarkers would be needed to increase the c-statistic by 0.05. Metabolites identi\ufb01ed may be enriched in well-recognized pathways associated with diabetes and its complications (DKD and CVD), such as insulin resistance, energy metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and transportation, in\ufb02ammation, and kidney function [ 163]. Although biomarkers from a shared pathway may indicate the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of the pathway, intercorrelation with established risk factors can limit their contribution to the predictive value of a model already including those risk factors [163]. 8.

Although biomarkers from a shared pathway may indicate the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of the pathway, intercorrelation with established risk factors can limit their contribution to the predictive value of a model already including those risk factors [163]. 8. Systems Biology: Integrating Multidimensional Data With advancement in technologies, the availability of multi-omics data such as se- quencing data (gene and ribonucleic acid), proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics has made it possible to investigate diabetes and its complications using a systems biology approach [ 164]. A proportion of interindividual variability of metabolite concentrations can be explained by genetics. Variants identi\ufb01ed in a large GWAS can account for up to 23% of the variance of metabolite concentrations [ 165]. Analysis performed in a Finnish Twin Cohort study found that the heritability estimates ranged between 23\u201355% for amino acids and other small-molecule metabolites and 48\u201376% for lipids and lipoproteins [ 166]. Some loci even explained up to 36% of the variance in circulating metabolites [ 167]. By using genetic variants associated with metabolites identi\ufb01ed in GWAS as instrumental variables, MR can be utilized to make causal inferences with observational data. As ge- netic variants are randomly assigned during meiosis and \ufb01xed at conception, MR can overcome issues of residual confounding or reverse causality commonly observed in epidemiological studies [ 168]. If a metabolite is causally associated with diabetes or its complications, it may become possible to identify potential drugs targeting the underlying mechanism as a new treatment strategy. Moreover, the integration of multi-omics data or even clinical data using systems biology approaches may identify previously unappreciated inter-relationships between different biological or molecular pathways. For example, by combining metabolomics and transcriptomics via a metabolite\u2013protein interaction network, four pathways associated with eGFR have been identi\ufb01ed to be affected by dapagli\ufb02ozin, which might shine a light on the potential renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2i [116]. In contrast to the rapid development of \u201comics\u201d technologies, statistical and computational techniques required to handle high-dimensional data, however, remain a major challenge and bottleneck [169]. 9. Exogenous Metabolites, Gut Microbiota, and Diabetes and Its Progression Exogenous inputs, such as food intake, affect the levels of circulating metabolites [ 170] and it has been increasingly appreciated that the gut microbiota play a key role in modify- ing the metabolome and metabolic homeostasis. Dietary phosphatidylcholines, including betaine, choline, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), have been found to be altered in individuals with CVD and appear to promote development of atherosclerosis [ 171]. Higher plasma TMAO by LC-MS was also associated with CVE in patients with T2D [ 127]. A recent bidirectional two-sample MR found that genetically predicted TMAO was not associated with T2D, CKD, or CVD, whereas T2D and CKD were causally associated with higher TMAO, indicating that TMAO may play a mediating role between diabetes/CKD and CVD [ 172].

Studies integrating metabolomics with genetics and gut microbiota have been implemented to explore the interplay be- tween genetic variants, dietary intake, gut microbiome and metabolites in diabetes and its complications [65,103]. 10. Conclusions and Perspectives Metabolomic studies present the molecular characterization of diabetes and its com- plications and could elucidate underlying pathological pathways that are perturbed in a disease state. Metabolomics, especially using the untargeted approach, can provide a global metabolic snapshot and may identify previously unknown molecules that are involved in the development and progression of diabetes. Metabolomic studies, as mentioned above, have identi\ufb01ed biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prediction of diabetes and its complications; some metabolites could also be biomarkers for monitoring the therapeutic effects of treatment. If being causal of a disease, the associated pathways could even be considered therapeutic targets. The integration of genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, or even clinical data in a systems approach may present a comprehensive metabolic network of cardiometabolic disease. In this regard, metabolomics is a powerful approach which can deepen the molecular understanding of and improve efforts towards preventing or improving clinical management of T2D and its complications.

Whereas the diagnosis and treatment of manifest diabetes have been well investigated , the identification of novel pathways or early biomarkers indicative of metabolic alterations or insulin resistance related to the development of diabetes is still in progress. Over half of the type 2 diabetes patients show manifestations of diabetes9related diseases, whi ch highlights the need for early screening markers of diabetes. During the last decade, the rapidly growing research field of metabolomics has introduced new insights into the pa thology of diabetes as well as methods to predict disease onset and revealed new biomarker. A recent epidemiological studies firstly used metabolism to predict incident diabetes and revealed branched9chain and aromatic amino acids including isoleucine, leucine, vali ne, tyrosine and phenylalanine as highly9significant predictors of future diabetes. This review summarizes the current findings of metabolic research in animal models and human investigat ions. Page 2 of 33 3INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2DM), represents one of t he most significant global health problems because it is associated with a large economic burden for the health systems of many countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) repo rted that worldwide 171 million subjects are affect by diabetes in 2000, which is equival ent to a prevalence of 2.8%, and these reports predicted an estimated future number of 366 mill ion affected individuals in 2030, which would be equivalent to a diabetes prevalence of 4.4% (Wild, et al. 2004). However, recent data of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) revealed t hat this number has already been achieved in 2011. The IDF expected an even higher number of 552 million affected persons in 2030. Due to the broad range of diabetes9related complications, including diabetic nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy and cardiovascular disease, diabetes is a major cause of both morbidity and mortality. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is characterised by high blood gl ucose levels, which may be due either to the progressive failure of pancreatic beta9cell function and consequently a lack of insulin production (type 1: T1DM) or to the development of insulin resistance and subsequently the loss in beta9cell function (T2DM). Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2DM. T1DM is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component."

Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2DM. T1DM is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component. Genetic susceptibility to T1DM has been intensively investigated, and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was reported to be the main genetic determinant (Noble and Erlich 2012; Polychronakos and Li 2011). The predominant cause of T2DM is related to lifestyle factors including diet, insufficient physical activit y, an overweight or obese state and stress. Furthermore, at least 36 genes, accounting for 10% of the total genetic component, have been significantly associated with an increased risk for T2DM (Herder and Roden 2011). Moreover, further 18 genes were related to glucose and HbA1c levels as well as insulin resistance. Detailed reviews on the genetics of T1DM and T2DM have been presented elsewhere (Herder and Roden 2011; Polychronakos and Li 2011). The diagnosis of diabetes is mainly based on the results of blood tests examini ng fasting plasma glucose or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels ( World Health Organization 2006). Page 3 of 33 4Additionally, the treatment of diabetes is linked to these measures, as the main goal of antidiabetic therapy is to reduce blood glucose and HbA1c levels via the administra tion of insulin (T1DM) or antidiabetic medication (T2DM). Furthermore, lifestyl e changes, such as eating a more healthful diet, performing regular physical activity, achiev ing a normal body weight and smoking cessation, are recommended for diabetic patients. Whereas the diagnosis and treatment of manifest diabetes have been thoroughly investigated, the identification of novel pathways or early biomarkers indi cative of metabolic alterations or insulin resistance related to the development of T2DM is still underway. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that estimated 57.9 % of subjects with diagnosed diabetes are affected by one or m ore macro9 or microvascular complications (American Association of Clinical Endoc rinologists 2007), which highlights the need for early screening markers to monitor the development o f T2DM. During the last decade, the rapidly growing research field of metabolomics has intr oduced new insights into the pathology of diabetes as well as methods to predict disease onset. In accordance with the other \u201comics\u201d techniques, such as genomics, transc riptomics or proteomics, the term metabonomics, which is synonymous with metabolomic s or metabolic profiling, was first introduced by Nicholson and colleagues in 1999 (Nichol son, et al. 1999). Metabolomics relates to measurements of the metabolome, which represents t he entire collection of all small9molecule metabolites present in any biological orga nism (Oliver, et al. 1998; Tweeddale, et al. 1998). The advantages of metabolomics over other \u201com ics\u201d technologies include its high level of sensitivity and its ability to enable t he analysis of relatively few metabolites compared with the unwieldy number of corres ponding genes or mRNA molecules.

The comprehensive Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) contai ned approximately 7900 metabolite entries in January 2009. Another advantage of metab olomics is that metabolites are the final downstream products of the interaction between genes and influences like environmental factors, health behaviour or pharmaceutical interventions, and metabolite levels reflect the activity of metabolic pathways. Theref ore, metabolomics enables Page 4 of 33 5the detection of short9term as well long9term physiological or pathologic al changes in cells, tissues or body fluids and represents a useful tool for biomarker detect ion. The purpose of the present review is to summarise current metabolomics t echnologies and to provide an overview of the contribution of metabolomics to diabetes resear ch. METABOLOMICS TECHNOLOGIES The two main high9throughput metabolomics tools consist of nuclear magnetic r esonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Both methods enable t he comprehensive investigation of metabolic profiles (Dunn, et al. 2005; Hollywood, et al. 2006 ; Lenz and Wilson 2007) and can provide complementary snapshots of the metabolome of bod y fluids such as plasma, urine or cerebrospinal fluid (Bictash, et al. 2010). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy NMR is a widely used spectroscopic technique for metabolomics that is bas ed on the magnetic properties of the atomic nucleus (e.g., 1H, 13C, or 31P). This method was first used for the analysis of body fluids in the 1980s (Bell, et al. 1989; Iles, et al. 1985; Nicholson, et al. 1984). The behaviour of NMR active nuclei in a strong magnetic field provides i nformation about the structural and chemical properties of a molecule. Due to the hi gh abundance of the 1H nucleus, 1H9NMR spectroscopy has been heavily utilised to investigate biological f luids such as plasma and urine as well as tissues. Each separate signal in a 1H9NMR spectrum corresponds to a particular compound. Exemplary 1H9NMR spectra for human urine and plasma are shown in figure 1.

Detailed information regarding NMR theory, its application and typical chemical s hift values is available elsewhere (Bl\u00fcmich 2005). The application of NMR spectroscopy in metabolomics ranges from pharmaceutical studies (Lindon, et al. 2007) to cardiovascular bi omarker identification (Griffin, et al. 2011; Rhee and Gerszten 2012).

The application of NMR spectroscopy in metabolomics ranges from pharmaceutical studies (Lindon, et al. 2007) to cardiovascular bi omarker identification (Griffin, et al. 2011; Rhee and Gerszten 2012). Advantages of NMR spectroscopy include the non9destructive nature of the analys is, the robust and reproducible measurements and the minimal preparation requirements, as no separation or ionisation steps are necessary. However, in comparison to MS, the analytical sensitivity of NMR is relatively low, even if stronger magnetic fi elds are used to increase the analytical sensitivity. Mass spectrometry MS is a powerful tool for investigating molecular structure as well as f or detecting and quantifying metabolites (Lenz and Wilson 2007). The first step in MS c onsists of the ionisation of the analyte, which is followed by the separation of the ions ac cording to their mass9to9charge (m/z) ratio using an analyser with an electromagnetic fiel d. In metabolomics, MS is often combined with other suitable methods for the analytical separ ation of compounds, including gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC), to achieve detection of distinct metabolite classes (Buscher, et al. 2009). One study comparing GC, LC and capillary electrophoresis (CE) revealed that LC was the most robust method and enabled the br oadest coverage of metabolite classes (Buscher et al. 2009). However, both GC9MS und LC9MS demonstrate high separation efficiency and are excellent tools for metaboli c profiling. Exemplary MS spectrum for human urine is shown in figure 2. The application of MS in the metabolomics field ranges from studies of microorganisms and plants to biomarker detection. The greatest advantage of the MS methods is their high level of sensitivity , although disadvantages arise from the destruction of the sample and the long sample preparat ion time Page 6 of 33 7required. Detailed descriptions of MS methods have been provided elsewhere (de Hoffmann and Stroobant 2007). Due to the limited overlap for metabolite detection and thus the compleme ntary nature of MS and NMR spectroscopy, studies using a multiplatform approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding of metabolic alterations than studies using only one of these tools (Williams, et al. 2006a). EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES APPLIED TO GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND DIABETES Dietary-induced obesity and insulin resistance A series of experimental studies have been conducted using dietary9induced obesity or insulin resistance rodent models to investigate the metabolic profiles of urine (Kim, et al. 2009), blood (Li, et al. 2010a; Shearer, et al. 2008) or tissue (Li et al. 2010a; Lin, et al. 2011), and these results have led to new insights into the development of diabetes. Dietary9induced obesity models have the advantage of being more similar to the development of human obesity in comparison to genetic models , and as a result, these models mirror the progression of insulin resistance and diabetes after a prolonged period of developmen t (Fearnside, et al. 2008).

High9fat9fed C57BL/6J mice become obese and insuli n resistant and demonstrate different serum levels of 1H9NMR9based metabolite concentrations in comparison to chow9fed mice (Shearer et al. 2008). Whereas the citrate concentration was higher in high9fat9fed mice than in chow9fed mice, the concentrations of glycine, lysine, suberate, acetate, leucine, valine or trimethylamine N9oxide were signif icantly lower in high9 fat9fed mice. Furthermore, dietary9induced insulin resistance could be predicted according to various metabolite levels, specifically those of lysine, glycine, cit rate, leucine, suberate and acetate, and these metabolite levels could also be used to discriminate between c how9 and high9fat9fed animals. Additionally, the urinary metabolic profiles of hi gh9fat9fed rats were significantly different from those of normal9diet9fed rats (Kim et al. 2009). 1H9NMR spectroscopy also revealed diet9related variations in the levels of betaine, taur ine, acetone/acetoacetate, phenylacetylglycine, pyruvate, lactate and citrate. MS9based studies Page 7 of 33 8can also detect additional diet9induced changes in metabolites (Li et al. 2010a; Lin et al. 2011); one study investigated the diet9induced inhibition of insulin in the l iver tissue and plasma of wild9type and glycerol939phosphate acyltransferase 1 (GPAT91)9de ficient mice, which remain insulin sensitive independent of their diet (Li et al. 2010a). As suming that metabolic changes identified in insulin9resistant wild9type mice are speci fically related to hepatic insulin resistance and may therefore indicate a causative pathwa y, these authors demonstrated alterations in the concentrations of 43 liver and 19 plasma metabol ites. The identified increases in urea cycle9related metabolites, such as citrull ine, aspartate or N9 acetyl9glutamate, were indicative of early up9regulation of the urea cyc le, whereas the altered levels of liver metabolites suggested the existence of variations in gluc ose metabolism (1,59 anhydroglucitol decrease), bile acid metabolism (taurocholate decrease) and pyrimidine metabolism (2\u20329deoxyuridine increase). Moreover, the increase in pyrimidi ne metabolites and the decreases in bradykinin, kynurenine and \u03b19ketoglutarate concentrations were al so confirmed in the plasma. A separate MS study extended this approach of diet 9induced insulin resistance to include a metabolic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and addit ionally examined liver, brain and skeletal tissues (Lin et al. 2011). These MS data enabled the authors to discriminate between both the 1209min and 09min time points for both standard9 fed (SD) and high9fructose9fed (HFrD) rats, and these data also identif ied specific metabolic effects in insulin9resistant rats. As expected, insulin adminis tration9related up9regulation of lysophosphatidylcholines (Lin et al. 2011) was observed in SD rats but not in HFrD rats. However, the levels of the branched9chain amino acids (BCAA) proline, tryptophan and methionine were decreased in HFrD rats at 120 min but were unchanged in SD rats , and opposite effects were observed for the amino acids leucine and isoleuc ine, which had previously been shown to be related to insulin sensitivity (Shaham, et al. 2008) and were present"

By comparing SD and HFrD rats at the 09min time point, differences were identified for various compounds, including phospholipids, ami no acids, bile acids, fatty acids and metabolites. Moreover, regarding purine metabolism and t he Krebs cycle, a complex metabolic perturbation in HFrD rats was observed. I ncreased levels of Page 8 of 33 9phospholipids and fatty acid were also found in high9fat9fed mice in combination wi th lower levels of betaine, carnitine and acylcarnitines, which are metabolites involved in lipid metabolism (Kim, et al. 2011). In liver and skeletal muscle tissue, a high9fructose diet leads to oxidative stress, elevated levels of amino acids and alterations in fatty acid biosynthesis, whereas this type of diet is related to decreased amino acid levels and the up9regulation of purine biosynthesis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Lin et al. 2011). In general, the distinction between diet9related effects and obesity9related ef fects represents a common problem in dietary9induced diabetes models. One recent study in mice investigated the long9 and short9term consequences of various types of di ets and aimed to distinguish the specific effects of each diet from those of obesity in gener al (Duggan, et al. 2011). The results revealed that diet has a major impact on the metabolic pr ofiles measured by 1H9NMR; whereas diet influenced metabolites related to energy and glucose metabolism, obesity mainly caused alterations in amino acids and large non9polar molecules . Genetic rodent models of diabetes Genetic T2DM models have several advantages over diet9induced models, including a s hort generation time, heritable traits and lower cost, although the \u201cnatural\u201d devel opment of diabetes over a prolonged period of time is lacking in these animals. The t wo most popular obesity/T2DM models include the db/db model and the obese Zucker (fa/fa) model, w hich are both characterised by an autosomal recessive defect in the leptin receptor gene that results in obesity and subsequent insulin resistance (Chen and Wang 2005). Based on these models, differences in urinary (Connor, et al. 2010; Gipson, et al. 2008; Patterson, et al. 2011; Salek, et al. 2007; Williams, et al. 2005a; Williams, et al. 2006b; Zhao, et al. 2010a), plasma (Major, et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2006a) and tissue (Connor et al. 2010; Xu, et al. 2009) metabolic profiles have been reported between affected and control rodents. Sever al studies have demonstrated profound alterations in metabolites involved in the tric arboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

The TCA cycle is an amphibolic pathway that occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays an important role in energy metabolism. The final Page 9 of 33 10products of fatty acid degradation and glycolysis are included in the TCA cycl e, and TCA cycle intermediates are involved in amino acid synthesis and degradation as well as gluconeogenesis. Whereas Zucker rats (Williams et al. 2005a; Williams et al. 2006b; Zhao et al. 2010a) typically have decreased urinary concentrations of TCA metabolites, suc h as citrate, malate, fumarate, 29ketoglutarate or succinate, the db/db mous e (Connor et al. 2010; Salek et al. 2007) has exhibited increased levels of TCA metabolites, and these change s are indicative of the down9 and up9regulation of the TCA cycle, respective ly. In a study with rhesus macaques, animals with T2DM demonstrated 29fold higher levels of citrat e compared to normal animals (Patterson et al. 2011). Additionally, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats with T1DM induced by streptozotocin demonstrated higher levels of pyruvate, succinate and f umarate (Zhang, et al. 2008). This study further showed strong associations between TCA c ycle intermediates and components of glucose metabolism in normal rats, specific ally between pyruvate, as the end product of glycolysis, and 29oxoglutarate, fumarat e or citrate. In diabetic rats, there was evidence for a disturbed balance between the TCA cycle and glucose metabolism, as the glucose levels were not associated with those of lact ate or various TCA cycle intermediates. Thus, the concentrations of succinate were not correl ated with those of 29oxoglutarate or citrate (Zhang et al. 2008). Beside disturbances in interm ediate correlations, the metabolite composition demonstrated a strong age9dependent variation. Wil liams and colleagues (Williams et al. 2006b) reported that the urinary ratios of \u03b19ketoglutarate and succinate to citrate were in favour of citrate at an age of four we eks in Zucker rats, although this finding was no longer apparent at 20 weeks. In db/db mice, a decrease i n the concentration of both TCA and non9TCA metabolites was also reported with age (Salek et al. 2007). Regarding taurine, the urinary levels in control and Zucker rats w ere comparable at eight weeks, whereas taurine was absent in 50% of the Zucker animals at 20 weeks (Williams et al. 2006b). Other metabolites involved in amino acid me tabolism have been shown to be associated with T2DM. For example, amino acids, such as p henylalanine, valine, tryptophan, lysine and glutamic acid, and amino acid metabolites, such as 29 hydroxyisobutyrate, 29hydroxyisovalerate and kynurenic acid, were present at highe r Page 10 of 33 11concentrations in the urine of Zucker rats (Connor et al. 2010; Gipson et al. 2008; Salek et al. 2007), db/db mice (Connor et al. 2010; Gipson et al. 2008) and monkeys (Patt erson et al. 2011) than in control animals, although lower concentrations of these compounds have also been reported (Salek et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2006b).

These results p rovide evidence for the complex perturbation of amino acid metabolism in diabetic disease. The largest portion of amino acid metabolism takes place in the liver, and although a broad ran ge of amino acids are glucogenic and are utilised for hepatic gluconeogenesis, a smaller number of a mino acids are ketogenic and are converted to ketone bodies. An additional rodent study (Moc hida, et al. 2011) on T1DM using the AKITA mouse model confirmed these previous urine findings and demonstrated higher amino acid, BCAA, alanine, citrulline and proline levels i n the plasma of T1DM rats indicative of disease state9dependent changes. As hyp erglycaemia progressed, the differences regarding the mentioned amino acids and BCAA became more pronounced. Additionally, these authors demonstrated a relation between increased blood glucose levels and increases in plasma levels of valine, leucine, isoleuci ne, BCAA and alanine (Mochida et al. 2011). In addition to insulin resistance, BCAA supplem entation to the high9fat diet leads to chronic increased activation of mTOR in rats (Newgard, et al. 2009), and overactivation of the mTOR/S6K1 pathway has been linked to the development of insulin resistance via beta9cell adaptation to hyperglycaemia (Fraenkel, et al. 2008; Khamzina, et al. 2005; Um, et al. 2004). Further details concerning the relation between a mino acids and diabetes are provided in the human studies section of this review. A series of rodent studies found increased urinary levels of fatty acids in Zucker rats (Salek et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2006b). Furthermore, higher levels of carnit ine, an essential compound for the transport of fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria, and one that is related to T2DM (De Palo, et al. 1981), have been observed in diabetic r odents (Connor et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2006b). A multiplatform study confirmed the enriched fatty acid metabolism of the db/db mouse by revealing increased transcript levels of f atty acid metabolism9associated carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt) in the liver and higher urinary carnitine levels, as measured using LC9MS (Gipson et al. 2008). Furthermore, increased Page 11 of 33 12carnitine levels with age were observed in db/db but not in control mice, and similar age9 dependent increases in carnitine were also reported in non9diabetic rats (Will iams, et al. 2005b). Increased fatty acid metabolism result from a higher rate of lipol ysis in adipose tissue and might exacerbate insulin resistance in liver and muscle tis sue (Delarue and Magnan 2007). High fatty acid levels subsequently lead to a higher oxidation rat e and therefore to the induction of ketogenesis. Thus, diabetic animals typicall y exhibit higher levels of ketone bodies, including \u03b29hydroxybutyrate or acetone, as compared to controls (Salek et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2010a). Similar to changes in amino acid levels,"

Similar to changes in amino acid levels, increased levels of ketone bodies have been associated with the diseased state as well as age (Sal ek et al. 2007). Taken together, the shift from euglycaemia towards hyperglycaemia is likely linked to pronounced metabolic perturbations and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction. Beside the previously mentioned metabolites, a wide range of additional urine or tissue metabol ites, e.g., choline, allantoin, glycine or betaine, has also been related to obesity or diabetes in different studies (Gipson et al. 2008; Patterson et al. 2011; Salek et al. 2007; Wil liams et al. 2005a; Williams et al. 2006b; Zhang et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2010a). Several studies have also detected differences in metabolites known to ori ginate from the gut microflora. For example, hippurate, which is mainly produced via gut microbial metabolism (Nicholson, et al. 2005), was shown to be elevated in db/db mice (Connor et al. 2010; Salek et al. 2007) but decreased in Zucker rats (Salek et al. 2007; William s et al. 2006b; Zhao et al. 2010a), whereas microbiota9derived methylamines such as dimethylamine or tr imethylamine9 N9oxide were shown to be increased in both types of rodents (Connor et al. 2010; Gipson et al. 2008; Salek et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2010a). Reasons for t his discrepancy may be related to differences in the composition of the intesti nal microflora. HUMAN STUDIES APPLIED TO GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND DIA BETES Glucose ingestion The OGTT measures the body\u2019s ability to metabolise glucose and clear exc ess glucose from the bloodstream. Since the 1970s, the OGTT has been a standard diagnostic tool i n Page 12 of 33 13diabetology. A 29h OGTT is routinely performed in fasting patients; pati ents drink a beverage containing a specific amount of glucose according to their body weight, and 2 h after the glucose load, the blood glucose concentration is measured and provides inf ormation on glucose tolerance. According to the WHO , in healthy individuals, the venous plasma glucose level should be below 7.8 mmol/l; values greater than this can be used to diagnose i mpaired glucose tolerance (7.8 9 11.1 mmol/l) or diabetes mellitus (\u226511.1 mmol/l) (World Health Organization 2006) . Several studies have investigated changes in the metabolic profile in relation to glucose ingestion (Matysik, et al. 2011; Shaham et al. 2008; Spegel, et al. 2010; Zhao, et al. 2009). An investigation (Shaham et al. 2008) among participants in the Metabolic Abnormalities in College Students (MACS) study who demonstrated normal glucose tolerance revealed significant kinetic alterations in 21 out of 191 plasma metabolites, as m easured by LC9MS, in response to an OGTT.

        "text": "Metabolic Abnormalities in College Students (MACS) study who demonstrated normal glucose tolerance revealed significant kinetic alterations in 21 out of 191 plasma metabolites, as m easured by LC9MS, in response to an OGTT. Eighteen of these metabolites were independently identif ied in subjects from the Framingham Offspring Study, and several metabol ites, including glucose, lactate, hippurate and glycerol, had also been previously related to gluc ose metabolism (Pelkonen, et al. 1967). However, this study demonstrated novel changes in the l evels of bile acids following the OGTT; the levels of three bile acids, glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), w ere increased within the first 30 min following glucose ingestion and remained st able thereafter. Another study (Zhao et al. 2009) examining healthy individuals revealed similar r esults concerning these bile acids and reported as much as a 69fold increase in these level s after 30 min (followed by a subsequent decrease). Both findings were confirmed by a thir d study (Matysik et al. 2011) that investigated bile acid signalling during the cours e of an OGTT in relation to 15 conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. In normal subjects, the level s of GCDCA, the bile acid with the highest plasma levels, and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) increased within the first 60 min of the OGTT. Furthermore, this study found that in response to oral glucose ingestion, the levels of all of the examined glycine9 and taurine9conjugated bile acids were increased at 60 min and declined slightly over the following 60 min, whereas Page 13 of 33 14the levels of unconjugated bile acids, e.g., cholic acid, lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, declined throughout the course of the OGTT. Bile acids are produced in the liver by the oxidation of cholesterol and are stored in the gall bladder. Upon food intake, bile ac ids are released into the duodenum and small intestine and facilitate the intesti nal absorption of nutrients, particularly dietary fat, drugs and steroids. The majorit y of excreted bile acids are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and return to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation, and very low levels of bile acids are found in the systemic circulation. Beside their major role in dietary lipid absorption, bile acids are metabolic factors that play regulatory roles in fat, glucose and energy metabolism (Houten, et al. 2006; Lefebvre, et al. 2009). The report ed increase in bile acids in response to glucose ingestion is in concordance with a 3 9fold increase in the levels of bile acids in human serum following a standard liqui d meal (De Barros, et al. 1982). Furthermore, oral glucose ingestion leads to increased lev els of cholecystokinin, a hormone that stimulates the production of hepatic bile and gal l bladder contractions (Liddle, et al. 1985). The link between bile acids and glucose homeostas is was further confirmed by the demonstration of enhanced CYP7A1 mRNA expressi on following insulin injection or oral glucose administration in fasting mice (Li, et al. 2012).

The link between bile acids and glucose homeostas is was further confirmed by the demonstration of enhanced CYP7A1 mRNA expressi on following insulin injection or oral glucose administration in fasting mice (Li, et al. 2012). Additionally, in primary human hepatocytes, insulin and glucose were shown to stimulate CYP7A1 mRNA expression (Li, et al. 2010b; Li, et al. 2006), which suggests the existence of glucose/insulin9 regulated gene transcription in the liver. The CYP7A1 gene encodes the enzyme c holesterol 7\u03b19hydroxylase, which is the rate9limiting enzyme in the cholesterol catabolic pathway and the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and therefore represents a major point of regulation during bile acid synthesis. The direct glucose/insulin9stimulated ex pression of CYP7A1 leads to an increased bile acid pool size. Taken together, these findings indicate an important connection between bile acid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. He nce, it is not surprising that the bile acid metabolism is altered in patients w ith diabetes (Prawitt, et al. 2011). In addition, a metabonomic study revealed higher plasma levels of GCDC A in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, as compared to subjects with normal glucose tolerance (Zhao, et al. 2010b). Another study detected differences in the compo sition of the Page 14 of 33 15bile acid pool between T2DM patients and controls (Brufau, et al. 2010). Wher eas the size of the total bile acid pool was not different, T2DM subjects demonstrated increased deoxycholic acid input rates and cholic acid synthesis rates but exhibited a lower proportion o f CDCA. Furthermore, therapy with bile acid sequestrants leads to the expected reductions i n both total cholesterol and low9density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as i mprovements in glycaemic control in T2DM patients (Garg and Grundy 1994; Kondo and Kadowaki 2010; Suzuki, et al. 2006; Zieve, et al. 2007). Compared to patients who received co ntrol treatments or placebos, T2DM patients given bile acid sequestrants demonstrat ed greater reductions in the levels of plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin. In regards to the OGTT studies, metabolites beside bile acids were also altered during the OGTT in healthy subjects. In fact, increases in lysophosphatidylcholine (Z hao et al. 2009) and decreases in amino acids (Table 1) (Shaham et al. 2008; Spegel et al. 2010) , acylcarnitines (Zhao et al. 2009) and fatty acids (Table 2) (Spegel et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2009) were reported. The study by Zhao et al. (Zhao et al. 2009) provided a mor e systematic overview of fatty acid plasma changes during an OGTT; although the levels of f atty acids declined during an OGTT, the levels of saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were more significantly decreased than those of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Moreover, a substantial reduction in the SFA/MUFA ratio was observed, consisting of a shift from MUFA towards SFA. These findings indicate a change in fatty acid composition following an OGTT.

Moreover, a substantial reduction in the SFA/MUFA ratio was observed, consisting of a shift from MUFA towards SFA. These findings indicate a change in fatty acid composition following an OGTT. A more detailed discussion on this topic is presente d in the next chapter. Overall, metabolic studies have revealed alterations in metabolites relat ed to pathways involved in the action of insulin, including lipolysis, ketogenesis, proteo lysis and glucose metabolism. These results indicate a change from beta9oxidation to glyc olysis and fat storage in response to glucose ingestion. Patient investigations Comparisons between the levels of various metabolites in diabetic patients and healthy controls have confirmed many of the findings from animal studies as well as studies Page 15 of 33 16investigating metabolic changes during an OGTT. These findings from human patient s can be summarised as follows: 1) As expected, diabetic patients exhibited differences in glucose metabolism . Patients with T1DM under insulin deprivation (Lanza, et al. 2010) or in T2DM (Li, et al. 2009; Suhre, et al. 2010) demonstrated elevated glucose or mannose levels as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, in both T1DM and T2DM patients (Messana, et al. 1998; Zuppi, et al. 2002) increased lactate levels were observed, at which thes e levels increased with the grade of glucosuria in T2DM patients (Messana et al . 1998). 2) With respect to TCA cycle metabolites (and similar to db/db mice), patients with T1DM (Zuppi et al. 2002) and T2DM (Messana et al. 1998) had higher levels of ci trate, and these levels were also associated with increasing glucosuria (Messana et al. 1998). An additional study investigated the metabolic profiles of children w ho later progressed to T1DM and found decreased succinate and citrate levels at the tim e of birth (Oresic, et al. 2008). 3) The above9mentioned results were further confirmed in regards to the levels of ketone bodies during diabetes. Higher levels of acetone, acetoacetate and \u03b29 hydroxybutyrate were observed in insulin9deprived T1DM (Lanza et al. 2010) and T2DM (Messana et al. 1998; Nicholson et al. 1984; Suhre et al. 2010) subjects, indicating ketoacidotic metabolic decompensation. 4) Additionally, alterations in intestinal microflora9associated metabolit es have been detected. Insulin9deprived T1DM and T2DM patients exhibited elevated levels of hippurate, dimethylamine or trimethylamine9N9oxide (Messana et al. 1998; Zuppi et al. 2002), although a separate study observed lower levels of hippurate and 39 hydroxyhippurate among pre9diabetic individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (Zhao et al. 2010b). The human gut microbiota has an important role in health, which has been comprehensively discussed by several authors (Fujimura, et al. 2010; Nicholson et al. 2005; Prakash, et al. 2011) and is outside the focus of t he present review. Page 16 of 33 17Fatty acid alterations in patients with diabetes have been extensively exa mined.

In accordance with genetic rat models (Salek et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2006b), increased fatty acid levels were detected in T2DM patients (Li et al. 2009; Suhre et al. 20 10; Yi, et al. 2007; Yi, et al. 2008; Yi, et al. 2006) as well as in subjects with impaired gl ucose tolerance (Zhao et al. 2010b). Changes in as many as 18 fatty acids, including SFA, MUFA and PUFA, were found in one study. Furthermore, the metabolic profile of plasma acylcarni tines revealed higher fasting levels of long9chain saturated and monounsaturated acylcarnitines in obese and T2DM subjects as compared to lean controls (Mihalik, et al. 2010). M oreover, the levels of free carnitine were increased in both groups, although differences betw een groups were observed for short9 and medium9chain acylcarnitine species as well as hydr oxyacylcarnitines, where higher levels were observed in T2DM patients. Similar to an OGTT9induced reduction in acylcarnitines (Zhao et al. 2009), an insulin9stimulated euglycaemic clamp led to a decrease in all acylcarnitine species for all three of the investigated groups, although this reduction was blunted in patients with T2DM (Mihalik et al. 2010). All of the investigated fatty acids and acylcarnitines are listed in table 2. Many studies have demonstr ated that obese subjects often exhibit elevated fatty acid levels due to the enlarged volu me of adipose tissue (Jensen, et al. 1989; Newgard et al. 2009; Opie and Walfish 1963). Furthermore, higher levels of fatty acids are related to a greater risk for diabetes (Charl es, et al. 1997; Pankow, et al. 2004; Paolisso, et al. 1995), although the underlying mechanisms are not compl etely understood. However, elevated levels of free fatty acids induce insulin re sistance in muscle and liver tissue by decreasing insulin9stimulated glucose uptake and glycogenesis (Boden 2003; Griffin, et al. 1999; Wilding 2007). Moreover, the improvement in insulin sensitivity caused by a reduction in fatty acid levels supports these findings (Boden, et al. 1998; Cusi, et al. 2007; Santomauro, et al. 1999). At present, there are several hypotheses as to how free fatty acids interfere with insulin signalling; these are related to oxidative stress or inflammatory lipid pathways and have been reviewed by Boden (Boden 2011). An additional observation from patient studies is the change in amino acid levels in diabetic patients. A broad range of amino acids, including leucine, isoleucine, valine, pheny lalanine, Page 17 of 33 18tyrosine, alanine, tryptophan and homocitrulline, has been shown to be substantially increased in T1DM (Lanza et al. 2010) or T2DM patients (Messana et al. 1998; S uhre et al. 2010) as well as among subjects with obesity (Newgard et al. 2009) or impai red glucose tolerance (Zhao et al. 2010b).

In addition, these findings have been confirmed by st udies that revealed positive associations between amino acid levels and the homeostasi s model assessment index (Newgard et al. 2009) and insulin resistance of obese subjects , according to Bergman\u2019s minimal model (Huffman, et al. 2009). However, lower lev els of glycine, glutamate and threonine have been observed in diabetic patients and obese subjects (Lanza et al. 2010; Messana et al. 1998; Newgard et al. 2009). A recent investigation (W ang, et al. 2011) of the Framingham Offspring Study firstly examined the predict ive ability of fasting plasma metabolite levels for incident T2DM and showed that the amino acids i soleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine were elevated 12 years prior to the ons et of diabetes and were also linked to a higher diabetes risk. In fact, the combinati on of increased fasting isoleucine, tyrosine and phenylalanine levels at baseline was related to a gre ater than 59fold higher risk of incident diabetes. Moreover, these results were independent ly replicated in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. These studies have highlighted the impact of amino acids on the actions of insulin and consequently glucose metabolism. In the 1940s , Luetscher (Luetscher 1942) already reported higher amino acid levels among diabet ic patients, and this finding was later confirmed by the demonstration of the posit ive correlation between amino acid levels and insulin (Felig, et al. 1969). Furthermore, the intravenous administration of amino acids leads to the stimulation of insulin s ecretion. This insulinotropic effect differs depending on the specific amino acids in question (Floyd, et al. 1966; Floyd, et al. 1968). However, the underlying mechanisms are complex and are related to the inhibition of glucose transport and gluconeogenesis (Krebs, et al. 2002; Langenberg and Savage 2011; Patti, et al. 1998). Page 18 of 33 19CONCLUSION AND CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTRUE The application of metabolomics in diabetes studies has rapidly evolved during the las t decade and provides researchers with the opportunity to gain new insights in metaboli c profiling and pathophysiological mechanisms. Thus, several metabolites were identified to be related to diabetes or insulin resistance and represent the basis for the identification of novel diabetes biomarkers. Some findings were newly discovered altered metabolites e.g. bile acids, whereas other metabolic variations were already known e.g. fatty ac ids or amino acids. However, the results often led to a revalue of knowledge. Langenberg and colleague (Langenberg and Savage 2011) currently discuss the potential of an amino acid profile as predictor of T2DM and highlighted the fact that the addition of amino acids t o established risk factors only minimal improved the risk predication. This general problem is also apparent for genetic variants and other clinical novel biomarkers of diabetes whose power to add considerable improvement in risk assessment is limited (Lyssenko, et al. 2008; Meigs, et al. 2008; Salomaa, et al. 2010)."
