Identi\ufb01cation of biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of diabetes and its complications and better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of diabetes can facilitate individualized prevention and treatment. With the advancement of analytical techniques, metabolomics can iden- tify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner. Providing information on underlying metabolic pathways, metabolomics can further identify mechanisms of diabetes and its progression. The application of metabolomics in epidemiological studies have identi\ufb01ed novel biomarkers for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, such as branched-chain amino acids, metabolites of phenylalanine, metabolites involved in energy metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Metabolomics have also been applied to explore the potential pathways modulated by medications. Investigating diabetes using a systems biology approach by integrating metabolomics with other omics data, such as genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and clinical data can present a comprehensive metabolic network and facilitate causal inference. In this regard, metabolomics can deepen the molecular understanding, help identify potential therapeutic targets, and improve the pre- vention and management of T2D and its complications. The current review focused on metabolomic biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identi\ufb01ed from epidemiological studies, and will also provide a brief overview on metabolomic investigations for T2D.

        "text": "been projected that 700 million adults will have diabetes worldwide by 2045, with the majority being type 2 diabetes (T2D) [ 1]. Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD); whereby around 40% of individuals with T2D develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) [ 2], and DKD has become the major cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), contributing to half of new cases of ESKD each year [ 3]. Moreover, individuals with T2D have 2- to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death [ 4]. A multinational study including participants from South and East Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, South America, and Europe reported an approximate 50% prevalence of microvascular complications and 30% prevalence of macrovascular complications in T2D [ 5]. DKD characterized by impaired glomerular \ufb01ltration rate or albuminuria has been associated with increased risk of CVD and mortality [ 6,7]. Furthermore, CVD has been estimated to cause two-thirds of Cells 2021 ,10, 2832. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10112832 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 2 of 38 deaths in T2D [ 8]. Consequently, T2D has been ranked fourth among the disease burden worldwide [9], with a 2- to 3-fold increase in medical expenditures [10]. T2D is believed to arise due to complex interactions between genetic information, developmental exposures and environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and pollution [ 11,12]. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark feature of diabetes and has been utilized as a screening and diagnostic biomarker for diabetes, however, metabolic alteration leading to diabetes may be present decades before the onset of hyperglycemia. Modi\ufb01cation of lifestyle (diet and physical activity) could delay or even prevent the development of diabetes [ 13,14], highlighting the utility of powerful screening biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes. Given the increasing risks of adverse outcomes in diabetes and the availability of drugs proven to delay or prevent CVD and DKD [ 15\u201317], it is also critical to identify prognostic biomarkers involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications or predictive of future diabetic complications, which can facilitate clinicians\u2019 decision making and bene\ufb01t individuals at risk. Biomarkers indicating clinical response to speci\ufb01c medications can help identify individuals who may bene\ufb01t from the therapy compared with those who have no biological response. To improve the prevention and risk strati\ufb01cation of diabetes and its complications, as well as to maximize the bene\ufb01ts from interventions, approaches which provide novel insights into the etiology, diagnosis and prognosis of diabetes are much needed. With the rapid advancements in analytical techniques, it has become possible to identify and quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in a high-throughput manner, which has dramatically advanced approaches for biomarker discovery. 2. Metabolomics and Metabolites In 1971, Linus Pauling and colleagues introduced the concept of using quantitative and qualitative patterns of metabolites to understand the physiological status within a biological system [ 18]. Metabolites (with a small molecular mass < 1500 Da) can be endogenous compounds that are produced during endogenous catabolism or anabolism, such as amino acids, peptides, nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, organic acids,"

Metabolites (with a small molecular mass < 1500 Da) can be endogenous compounds that are produced during endogenous catabolism or anabolism, such as amino acids, peptides, nucleic acids, sugars, lipids, organic acids, and fatty acids (FAs), as well as exogenous chemicals, such as toxins and xenobiotics. The metabolome is termed as the complete collection of metabolites in a given biosample. Metabolomics is the method of comprehensively characterizing the metabolome in cells, organs, bio\ufb02uids, or other biological systems. Metabolomics is emerging as an attractive tool for biomarker discovery in diabetes and its complications, since metabolites can provide information on the molecular pathways involved in the development and progression of disease. Multiple factors contribute to the development of diabetes. Most genetic variants associated with T2D identi\ufb01ed in large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) only modestly contribute to the risk of diabetes. Among the identi\ufb01ed genetic variants, over 300 common genetic variants collectively explained only 16% of the variance of diabetes in a study which included around one million individuals of European decent [ 19]. Metabo- lites are, in general, the downstream products of gene expression, transcripts, protein transporters, and enzymatic reactions, which are closely correlated with genes in which a single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) base change in a given gene can result in 10,000-fold change in the level of endogenous metabolites [ 20] (Figure 1). Besides internal variations, metabolites can also be affected by exogenous factors, such as diet, lifestyle, physical activities, gut microbiota, and environmental pollution; thus, the metabolome is believed to re\ufb02ect the molecular pro\ufb01le most proximal to an individual\u2019s phenotype, since it integrates information from the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and enzymes as well as exogenous exposures (Figure 1).

Thus, metabolomics provid es a comprehensive molecular profile of a phenotype.

In the following section, we firstly introduce the analytical methods for metabolic profiling. 3. Analytical Methods 3.1. Untargeted and Targeted Metabolomics There are two analytical approaches for me tabolomics studies: untargeted and tar- geted. Untargeted metabolomics represents the unbiased appr oach to complete profiling of the metabolome, aiming to detect, identify , and quantify as many metabolites in a bio- logical sample as possible. The major strength of untargeted metabolomics is the possibil-ity of uncovering novel biom arkers and pathophysiological pathways of disease. How- ever, the annotation of unknown compounds often becomes a challenge, given the wide coverage of signals. In contrast, targeted me tabolomics aims to meas ure a prespecified set or cluster of chemical compounds, which ar e usually lying on the same metabolic path- ways or are structurally similar. Although only capable of provid ing limited information on the metabolic profiling, targeted metabolomics in general has higher sensitivity and selectivity, and can often provide a deeper understanding of the selected metabolites. 3.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy In sharp contrast to the genome, which comprises of only four nucleotide bases, or the proteome, which represents the different co mbinations of 20 proteogenic amino acids, the metabolome consists of chemical comp ounds belonging to thousands of different chemical classes [22] (Figure 1).

Given the diverse chemical properties and the wide Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 4 of 38 range of concentrations of metabolites, currently, no single platform can quantify the entire metabolome. The two most commonly used techniques are NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS), with the latter usually coupled to separation techniques, such as gas chromatography (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography (LC-MS). NMR works by the manipulation of the nuclear spin of certain atomic nuclei, such as1H,13C,15N, and31P , by exposing them to a strong external magnetic \ufb01eld, and then recording the frequency of electromagnetic radiation released as a result of nuclei relaxation.

Because the signal of a given nucleus is in\ufb02uenced by the neighboring atoms in a predictable way, the chemical shifts in its resonance frequency can thus be used to identify the underlying molecular structure. Since1H atoms can be found in most of the organic compounds, proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy (1H NMR) is widely employed in NMR-based metabolomics studies. NMR is noninvasive and nondestructive, and requires little or no sample preparation, chromatographic separation, or chemical derivatization; it can also be applied to in vivo tissues or to living samples, such as the real-time pro\ufb01ling of living cells and analysis of real-time metabolic \ufb02ux [ 23,24]. Another advantage of NMR is that NMR is especially suitable for assessing protein-bound metabolites (i.e., lipoprotein particles), and given the high automatability and reproducibility, NMR can be applied in large-scale metabolomics studies [ 25,26]. The major limitation of NMR, however, is its relatively low sensitivity (millimole to micromole per liter range), which is approximately 10 to 100 times less sensitive than MS. 3.3. Mass Spectrometry The high resolution and sensitivity of MS has made it the most widely used platform for metabolomic studies [ 27]. Compounds are \ufb01rst separated by chromatographic tech- niques (i.e., GC or LC) to reduce ion suppression, before quanti\ufb01cation and identi\ufb01cation by the mass spectrometer. GC-MS is a highly sensitive and suitable method for the separa- tion of volatile and thermally stable metabolites. GC-MS can separate naturally volatile compounds, such as ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, and furans, and compounds that can be made volatile by derivatization, such as sugars, amino acids, lipids, and or- ganic acids [ 28]. As chemical derivatization may alter the structure of compounds and unpredictable variations may occur during sample preparation, one of the drawbacks of GC-MS is its relatively low reproducibility [ 29]. Compared with GC-MS, LC-MS requires higher instrument costs, and suffers from lower reproducibility. LC-MS can separate a wide range of classes of compounds, from very polar to very nonpolar ones [ 30]. As compounds in bio\ufb02uids must be ionized prior to MS measurement, unlike GC-MS which utilizes the hard-ionization approach (i.e., electron-impact [EI] ionization), LC-MS often uses soft-ionization methods instead (i.e., electrospray ionization [ESI] and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization [APCI]), thus generating ions without fragmentation and allowing the identi\ufb01cation of unknown compounds [ 31,32]. Compared to GC-MS, one of the advantages of LC-MS is that chemical derivatization is not required in most conditions since high temperatures and volatility are no longer required. Moreover, LC-MS is in general more sensitive, covering compounds from low molecular weight to molecular weights beyond 600 Da, including phospholipids, conjugated bile acids, glycosides and sugars [ 33]. However, the major drawback of LC-MS as an untargeted platform is the lack of transferable mass"

Compared with NMR, although MS techniques have higher sensitivity, they are destructive and in general produce results which are comparatively less reproducible.

Metabolomics in Diabetes The characteristic perturbations of metabolic homeostasis associated with or preceding the development of hyperglycemia makes metabolomics a good method to elucidate the potential pathways and to explore potential biomarkers for T2D. Over the past two decades, metabolomics has been widely utilized in large epidemiological studies, and some metabolites/pathways have been identi\ufb01ed and validated to be associated with insulin metabolism or being predictive of diabetes across different studies [ 35].

BCAAs oxidation in adipose tissue and liver was decreased in people with insulin resistance, leading to elevated circulating BCAAs. Obese microbiomes could elevate BCAAs. One of the BCAAs, leucine, could activate the mTOR pathway. The above \ufb01ndings suggest a potential mediating role of BCAAs in the progression from insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes. Increased BCAAs oxidation in skeletal muscle depletes the intracellular pool of glycine and increases 3-hydroxyisobutyrate production, resulting in skeletal muscle lipotoxicity, which may be the mechanism linking BCAAs and insulin resistance.

Aromatic Amino Acids Tyrosine and phenylalanine, two kinds of AAAs, have also been associated with risk of diabetes [ 38,39,45,47,49,54,56,59,60]. Analyses in individuals with normal fasting glucose from the FHS found a positive association between phenylalanine and future diabetes, and the consistent \ufb01ndings in MR studies further supported a potential causal role of phenylalanine in the pathogenesis of diabetes [ 58]. A breakdown product of phenylalanine, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate, has been found to be associated with decreased insulin secretion and diabetes in the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study [ 63]. Results from the Southall Additionally, Brent Revisited (SABRE) study suggested a stronger association of tyrosine with diabetes in South Asians than in Europeans, indicating that the metabolic pro\ufb01le may differ between different ethnicities, and that metabolites may be helpful towards exploring ethnic differences in diabetes incidence.

Tyrosine may be an ideal predictive biomarker for diabetes in South Asians [45]. 4.1.3. Other Amino Acids Glycine, a nonessential amino acid [ 72], was found to be inversely associated with diabetes in Europeans [ 40,42,47,58], whereas a positive association has been reported in a Chinese population [ 51]. The MR analysis from the FHS suggested a potential causal link between glycine and diabetes, with the genetically predicted glycine being inversely associated with risk of diabetes [ 58]. However, a study including 74,124 T2D cases and 824,006 controls did not \ufb01nd an association between genetically predicted glycine and diabetes risk [ 73]. Furthermore, the study found that genetically higher insulin resistance was associated with lower levels of glycine, suggesting a mediating role of glycine between insulin resistance and diabetes [ 73]. Alanine, a nonessential amino acid synthesized from pyruvate and BCAAs, has also been reported to be associated with diabetes [ 39,47,49,54,56]. Glutamate, synthesized from -ketoglutaric acid in the citric acid cycle, has been found to be associated with the risk of diabetes [ 47,52,60] and a reverse association of glutamine, a transamination product of glutamate, has been reported [ 39,52]. The biological roles of these amino acids in the development of diabetes are, however, yet to be elucidated. 4.2. Organic Acids Alpha-hydroxybutyrate, a product of threonine and methionine, upstream of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, has been associated with impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [ 41,50,52,53,63]. Ketone bodies are an important alternative energy source during fasting, and levels of ketone bodies represent the balance of production (ketogenesis) and utilization (ketolysis). Acetoacetate, converted from free fatty acids (FFAs), has been associated with impaired insulin secretion and diabetes [43]. 4.3. Lipids 4.3.1. Lipoproteins Individuals with T2D commonly exhibit dyslipidemia, namely, high levels of triglyc- erides and small dense LDL particles, low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles- terol, and normal or near-normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels [ 74]. NMR has emerged as a novel method to measure lipoprotein particles [ 75], and has been applied in investigations on lipoproteins and onset of diabetes. In the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) size and small HDL were associated with increased risk of diabetes, independent of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol in prediabetic subjects [ 36]. In the Women\u2019s Health Study (WHS), both lipopro- tein particle size and concentration have been associated with incident diabetes during 13-year follow-up; VLDL size, total/large/small VLDL concentration, and small LDL and HDL were positively associated with diabetes, while large LDL and HDL were inversely associated [ 37]. Analyses from Finnish populations have also found a positive association for VLDL and a negative association for HDL [ 46,59]. Recent analyses from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study with detailed HDL subspecies Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 14 of 38 measurements reported heterogeneous associations between HDL subclasses and inci- dent diabetes: larger HDL size"

Fatty Acids FFAs are produced during hydrolysis of triglycerides [ 76]. Under the insulin-resistant state, increased lipolysis leads to overproduction of FFAs. In the METSIM study, saturated FAs were associated with increased risk of diabetes, while an inverse association has been found between unsaturated FAs and diabetes [ 44]. Furthermore, monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs%) were associated with risk of diabetes in a prospective study combining four Finnish cohorts over 8\u201315 years of follow-up, and polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs%), mainly n-6 FAs, were associated with decreased risk of diabetes [ 59]. A two-sample MR study suggested potential causal associations between FAs and fasting glucose, beta cell function, and diabetes [ 77]. Genetically predicted linoleic acid, the main n-6 PUFAs, has been consis- tently associated with lower risk of diabetes in a two-sample MR using different genetic variants and analytical approaches [ 78]. FAs can be derived from dietary triglycerides and phospholipids and dietary counselling has been shown to modify circulating FAs levels [ 79]. With possible causal links with diabetes, FAs may be emerging as new intervention targets for the prevention of diabetes. 5. Metabolomics in Diabetic Kidney Disease The kidneys are metabolically active organs involved in modulating the circulating levels of metabolites through \ufb01ltration, reabsorption, secretion, and metabolism (including catabolism and anabolism). Consequently, changes in metabolite concentrations may re\ufb02ect kidney function, and these changes may even precede the onset or progression of kidney disease, hence providing insights into the development and progression of DKD. Creatinine is one of the commonly applied metabolites that is freely \ufb01ltered at the glomerulus, and not reabsorbed, with only limited secretion by tubules [ 80]. Serum creatinine can be used to estimate glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (eGFR) noninvasively, however, creatinine is signi\ufb01cantly increased at more advanced stages of CKD (CKD stage three and onward) and is affected by age, sex, race, and muscle mass. The identi\ufb01cation of early markers is warranted given the availability of treatments which can prevent and delay DKD progression. Metabolomic studies have been applied to investigate blood or urine metabolomic biomarkers for DKD and have provided novel insights into the mechanisms leading to DKD and its progression, which make potential therapeutic targets possible.

Analyses from the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modi\ufb01ed Release Controlled Eval- uation (ADVANCE) trial found a crude association of phenylalanine with macrovascular disease and all-cause mortality in T2D, however, adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the associations, and phenylalanine was not associated with microvascular disease prospectively [ 95]. Tyrosine is synthetized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine through phenylalanine hydroxylase. In the setting of CKD, dysfunctional activity of pheny- lalanine hydroxylase leads to impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, resulting in higher phenylalanine and lower tyrosine [ 109]. In contrast to phenylalanine, tyrosine has been both cross-sectionally [ 106] and prospectively [ 93,95] associated with DKD. A higher level of tyrosine has been associated with higher baseline eGFR [ 106] and lower risk of microvascular disease in ADVANCE [ 95].

The downstream metabolite of tyrosine (o-sulfotyrosine) has been positively associated with ESKD in a Joslin proteinuria cohort including patients with T1D, proteinuria and stage three CKD [93]. 5.1.3. Other Amino Acids Leucine and isoleucine have been inversely associated with baseline eGFR in patients with T2D using NMR [ 106]. However, a study from Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen using GC-MS found that BCAAs were associated with lower risk of a combined endpoint (kidney dysfunction or all-cause mortality) in patients with T1D [ 99]. A study from ADVANCE also found that leucine and valine were inversely associated with all-cause mortality in patients with T2D, while alanine, synthesized from BCAAs, was inversely associated with microvascular disease, indicating the complex interactions between BCAAs and diabetes and its complications [ 95]. Threonine, an essential amino acid involved in the production of glycine, has been associated with lower risk of rapid eGFR decline in patients with T1D [ 102], and the downstream metabolite of threonine (n-acetylthreonine) was predictive of fast eGFR decline in patients with T2D [ 91] and ESKD in patients with T1D [93]. 5.1.4. Organic Acids Involved in Energy Metabolism Uracil, a pyrimidine derivative, was altered in urine samples from patients with DKD [ 85,92]. Pseudouridine, synthesized from uracil, showed association with eGFR decline and urinary albumin\u2013creatinine ratio (UACR) increase in patients with T2D [ 91] and ESKD in patients with T1D or T2D from studies in Joslin [ 88,93]. 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, a catabolic intermediate of valine which is produced in mitochondria, has been shown to be altered in patients with DKD [ 85] and has been found to be associated with ESKD in patients with diabetes in the Chronic Renal Insuf\ufb01ciency Cohort (CRIC) Study [ 105]. Alpha-hydroxybutyrate, positively associated with insulin resistance and diabetes as men- tioned above, however, has been found to be associated with lower risk of ESKD in patients with T2D [ 88]. Glycine has been found to be reduced in urine samples from patients with established DKD [ 92], and glycolic acid, an intermediate of glycine, was also re- duced [ 85,92] and was associated with ESKD in analyses from CRIC [ 105]. Acetoacetate has also been inversely associated with baseline eGFR in patients with T2D [ 106], and 2-methylacetoacetate, an intermediate of isoleucine metabolism, was reduced in urine from patients with DKD [ 85]. The abovementioned metabolites are all produced in the mito- chondria and are involved in energy metabolism, suggesting that mitochondrial function is dysregulated in DKD. 5.2. Lipids 5.2.1. Lipoproteins HDL particles and their composition (cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1) have been found to be cross-sectionally associated with higher baseline eGFR in studies combining several T2D cohorts using NMR, whereas triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their lipid Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 23 of 38 components were inversely associated, and HDL particles were also negatively associated with albuminuria [ 97,106].

A two-sample MR study using the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium ( n= 188,577) and the CKD Genetics Consortium ( n= 133,814) suggested a causal link between HDL cholesterol and better kidney function: genetically increased HDL cholesterol was associated with 0.8% higher eGFR and lower risk of incident CKD, and this \ufb01nding was robust in all the sensitivity analyses; however, there was no strong evidence supporting causal associations of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with baseline eGFR/UACR or incident CKD [110]. 5.2.2. Phospholipids Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the two most abun- dant phospholipids of mammalian cell types, comprising 40\u201350% and 15\u201325% of the total cellular phospholipids, respectively [ 111]. A case\u2013control study found lower plasma levels of PCs metabolites in patients with T2D and overt DKD (macroalbuminuria or CKD), and this \ufb01nding was replicated in another group of patients [ 90]. A prospective analysis from the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) also found that serum PCs were predictive of incident CKD in hyperglycemic patients, independent of conventional risk factors [ 104]. Unsaturated PEs have been found to be distinguishable between progressors ( \u001540% eGFR reduction) and nonprogressors in patients with T2D and baseline eGFR \u001590 mL/min/1.73 m2[98]. Sphingolipids are also important constituents of cell membranes and have been involved in cell signaling and activation. Ceramides, the essential precursors of sphingolipids, and sphingomyelin, the most common sphingolipids, were altered in patients with DKD. Higher plasma levels of ceramide metabolites have been reported in patients with DKD [ 90]; studies from the Diabetes Control and Compli- cations Trial (DCCT) study found that higher plasma levels of very-long-chain ceramides were associated with incident macroalbuminuria in patients with T1D during 14\u201320 years of follow-up [ 87]. Sphingomyelin level has been found to be elevated in patients with DKD [ 84] and was associated with incident CKD in hyperglycemic patients [ 104] and progression of DKD in patients with T1D [107]. 5.2.3. Fatty Acids and Acylcarnitines Apart from the link between insulin resistance and diabetes, FFAs have also been found to be predictive of DKD progression. Among patients with T2D and baseline eGFR \u001590 mL/min/1.73 m2, unsaturated FFAs were associated with lower risk of \u001540% eGFR reduction during follow-up [ 98]. Although associated with macrovascular events and death, FAs were however, not associated with microvascular events or onset or worsening of nephropathy in the ADVANCE trial [ 112]. Acylcarnitines, involved in the -oxidation of FAs in the mitochondria and barely detectable in nonpathological conditions, have also been found to be elevated in DKD [ 90].

C16-acylcarnitine was a strong predictor of fast eGFR decline in patients with T2D and CKD at baseline, independent of traditional risk factors [ 89]. Disturbed lipid metabolism (remodeling of sphingolipid or impaired -oxidation of FAs) indicates once again the perturbation of energy metabolism and the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of DKD. 5.3. Sodium\u2013Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i) SGLT2i reduced the risk of albuminuria and progression of DKD in patients with T2D in multiple clinical trials [ 15,113,114], however, its underlying effective pathways remain unclear. Metabolomics have been applied to explore potential molecular mechanisms mediating the protective effects of SGLT2i on DKD. Dapagli\ufb02ozin has been suggested to improve mitochondrial function. Levels of a panel of urinary metabolites previously linked to mitochondrial dysfunction were increased after 6-week of treatment using GC- MS [ 115]. A study combining metabolomics (plasma) and transcriptomics (kidney biopsy) found three pathways linked with energy metabolism or mitochondrial function have been affected by dapagli\ufb02ozin, namely, glycine degradation (mitochondrial function), Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 24 of 38 tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) II (energy metabolism), and L-carnitine biosynthesis (energy metabolism) [ 116]. The improvement of mitochondrial function by SGLT2i as the underlying mechanism to delay the development and progression of DKD further supports the observation that mitochondria play a role in DKD. 5.4. Current Challenges in Metabolomics Studies in DKD The kidney itself can modulate the metabolic pathways, which as a result, affects the levels of circulating metabolites. Furthermore, the de\ufb01nition of CKD in most of the current studies is based on eGFR rather than the measured glomerular \ufb01ltration rate, while eGFR is insuf\ufb01cient to re\ufb02ect early kidney dysfunction. Although changes in metabolites may precede the onset or progression of DKD, they may be resulted from early DKD which is not re\ufb02ected by clinical manifestations or the surrogate markers (i.e., eGFR). For example, tyrosine is positively associated with baseline eGFR [ 106], as improved kidney function induces increased production of tyrosine from phenylalanine [ 109]. Tyrosine and its downstream metabolites are also predictive of onset or worsening of nephropathy [ 95] and ESKD [ 93], which may be due to the link between tyrosine and kidney function, that tyrosine metabolism as a re\ufb02ection of kidney function can predict renal outcomes rather than being a physiological pathway. The complex interplay between the kidney and metabolites makes causal inference dif\ufb01cult. However, some metabolites are predictive of DKD independent of baseline eGFR and albuminuria, highlighting their value as prognostic biomarkers. Moreover, the lack of large, prospective cohort studies and independent replications limit the interpretations of these observations and clinical utility of potential biomarkers. 6. Metabolomics in Cardiovascular Disease The heart is responsible for around 10% of the fuel consumption of whole body [ 117] and beats around 2.5 to 4 billion times over an average human life, even though myocardial energy stores are only enough for several heart beats [ 118]."

Metabolomics in Cardiovascular Disease The heart is responsible for around 10% of the fuel consumption of whole body [ 117] and beats around 2.5 to 4 billion times over an average human life, even though myocardial energy stores are only enough for several heart beats [ 118]. To meet these high energy need, the heart consumes more than 20 g of carbohydrates and 30 g of fat per day and uses 35 L of oxygen to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [ 117]. The metabolism in the heart is highly \ufb02exible, such that it can alter the energy utilization rapidly to adapt to the changes in environment via using different kinds of energy substrates, including glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies, and amino acids [ 119]. The perturbations of metabolism in the heart can usually be re\ufb02ected by the changes in the involved circulating metabolites. Detection and quanti\ufb01cation of these metabolites provide a way to investigate the under- lying pathogenic mechanisms of CVD. Moreover, some of the metabolites have potential to be biomarkers (i.e., screening, diagnostic, or prognostic biomarkers). Metabolomics have been comprehensively applied in studying CVD in the general population and CVD cohorts [ 119,120].Table 4 summarizes metabolomics studies in CVD in people with dia- betes [95,107,112,121\u2013127].

ADMA ADMA has been found to be elevated in patients with CVD and associated with higher odds of CVD in a cross-sectional study of patients with T2D [ 122]. ADMA was also predictive of cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with T2D [ 124] and patients with T1D and DKD [ 123]. Higher risks of faster eGFR decline and ESKD in patients with higher ADMA [ 123] suggest that endothelial dysfunction may be a shared mechanism responsible for vascular complications (cardiorenal complications) in diabetes. 6.1.2. Other Amino Acids Besides the link with diabetes, BCAAs, tyrosine, and phenylalanine have been found to be associated with intima-media thickness and incident CVD in population-based stud- ies [128\u2013130]. Higher phenylalanine was associated with risk of macrovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, sex, region, and randomized treatment in the ADVANCE trial, however, further adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors attenuated the association [ 95].

Glutamine and histidine, inversely associated with dia- betes [ 39,52], were also inversely associated with macrovascular outcomes in ADVANCE, although adjustment for risk factors attenuated the associations [ 95]. Although negatively associated with kidney function [ 106], phenylalanine has been associated with higher risk of incident heart failure and showed added value on the risk-strati\ufb01cation of heart failure [ 131]. A CVD index composed of six amino acids (ethanolamine, hydroxyproline, glutamic acid, 3-methylhistidine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) was predictive of CVD [ 125]. The altered levels of amino acids in diabetes, DKD and CVD might suggest some shared pathways or mechanisms leading to diabetes and its complications. 6.2. Lipids 6.2.1. HDL Despite the inverse association between HDL cholesterol and risk of CVD in epi- demiological studies, MR studies and randomized clinical trials to raise HDL cholesterol level failed to \ufb01nd a protective effect of HDL cholesterol on CVD [ 132\u2013139]. HDL parti- cles are highly heterogeneous in size, structure, composition, and function [ 140]. Recent structural and functional studies suggested that the biological function of HDL particles differed in size with small, dense, and protein-rich HDL particles involved in the \ufb01rst step of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) by mediating the effect of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) [ 141,142]. Besides mediating RCT from macrophages, small HDL particles also have anti-in\ufb02ammatory, antioxidant, and endothelial protective functions (Figure 4) [143\u2013146] . In line with this, small HDL particles have been found to be inversely associated with CVD, stroke, CV death, or all-cause mortality in some well-established studies [ 147\u2013154]. Nevertheless, contrasting \ufb01ndings have also been reported [ 155,156]. There seems to be a bidirectional relationship between T2D and HDL whereby diabetes could also modulate the composition and function of HDL [ 157]. Concentration of large HDL particle and HDL particle size have been found to be increased in patients with T1D compared with participants without diabetes, while small HDL and total HDL par- ticle concentration were reduced [ 158]. A nested case\u2013control study from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study found that HDL particle subclasses were predictive of incident coronary artery disease in patients with T1D [ 121]. Large HDL parti- cle size was associated with risk of death in the Catheterization Genetics (CATHGEN) study and a positive association has been found between higher large HDL particle concentration and death in patients with preserved-ejection-fraction heart failure and patients without heart failure, even after stringent Bonferroni correction and comprehensive adjustment including HDL cholesterol [ 147]. A nested case\u2013control study from the Prevenci \u00f3n con Dieta Mediterr \u00e1nea (PREDIMED) cohort measured HDL functional characteristics and found that lower levels of HDL function markers were associated with higher odds of acute coronary syndrome independent of HDL cholesterol in patients at high CV risk [ 159].

An inverse association between n-3 FAs and death has also been reported [112 ], indicating the potential of FAs as prog- nostic biomarkers for CVD in patients with di abetes. Further exploration of the causal role of FAs on CVD may help confirm whether FA s may be therapeutic targets.

Despite being predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with diabetes, most of the metabolites (sphingomyelin, amino acids and FAs) failed to increase the c-statistic on top of established risk factors [ 95,107,112]. As demonstrated by Wang and colleagues, the key determinant of the predictive value of multiple biomarkers was the degree of correlation between biomarkers [ 161,162]. To improve the c-statistic by 0.05, more than 50 moderately correlated (r = 0.4) biomarkers were needed; while when the biomarkers were weakly correlated (r = 0.05), less than 10 biomarkers would be needed to increase the c-statistic by 0.05. Metabolites identi\ufb01ed may be enriched in well-recognized pathways associated with diabetes and its complications (DKD and CVD), such as insulin resistance, energy metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and transportation, in\ufb02ammation, and kidney function [ 163]. Although biomarkers from a shared pathway may indicate the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of the pathway, intercorrelation with established risk factors can limit their contribution to the predictive value of a model already including those risk factors [163]. 8.

Although biomarkers from a shared pathway may indicate the mechanistic role and therapeutic potential of the pathway, intercorrelation with established risk factors can limit their contribution to the predictive value of a model already including those risk factors [163]. 8. Systems Biology: Integrating Multidimensional Data With advancement in technologies, the availability of multi-omics data such as se- quencing data (gene and ribonucleic acid), proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics has made it possible to investigate diabetes and its complications using a systems biology approach [ 164]. A proportion of interindividual variability of metabolite concentrations can be explained by genetics. Variants identi\ufb01ed in a large GWAS can account for up to 23% of the variance of metabolite concentrations [ 165]. Analysis performed in a Finnish Twin Cohort study found that the heritability estimates ranged between 23\u201355% for amino acids and other small-molecule metabolites and 48\u201376% for lipids and lipoproteins [ 166]. Some loci even explained up to 36% of the variance in circulating metabolites [ 167]. By using genetic variants associated with metabolites identi\ufb01ed in GWAS as instrumental variables, MR can be utilized to make causal inferences with observational data. As ge- netic variants are randomly assigned during meiosis and \ufb01xed at conception, MR can overcome issues of residual confounding or reverse causality commonly observed in epidemiological studies [ 168]. If a metabolite is causally associated with diabetes or its complications, it may become possible to identify potential drugs targeting the underlying mechanism as a new treatment strategy. Moreover, the integration of multi-omics data or even clinical data using systems biology approaches may identify previously unappreciated inter-relationships between different biological or molecular pathways. For example, by combining metabolomics and transcriptomics via a metabolite\u2013protein interaction network, four pathways associated with eGFR have been identi\ufb01ed to be affected by dapagli\ufb02ozin, which might shine a light on the potential renoprotective mechanisms of SGLT2i [116]. In contrast to the rapid development of \u201comics\u201d technologies, statistical and computational techniques required to handle high-dimensional data, however, remain a major challenge and bottleneck [169]. 9. Exogenous Metabolites, Gut Microbiota, and Diabetes and Its Progression Exogenous inputs, such as food intake, affect the levels of circulating metabolites [ 170] and it has been increasingly appreciated that the gut microbiota play a key role in modify- ing the metabolome and metabolic homeostasis. Dietary phosphatidylcholines, including betaine, choline, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), have been found to be altered in individuals with CVD and appear to promote development of atherosclerosis [ 171]. Higher plasma TMAO by LC-MS was also associated with CVE in patients with T2D [ 127]. A recent bidirectional two-sample MR found that genetically predicted TMAO was not associated with T2D, CKD, or CVD, whereas T2D and CKD were causally associated with higher TMAO, indicating that TMAO may play a mediating role between diabetes/CKD and CVD [ 172].

Using untargeted LC-MS, more microbial metabolites have been found to be Cells 2021 ,10, 2832 30 of 38 predictive of incident diabetes in the METSIM study [ 63]. Studies integrating metabolomics with genetics and gut microbiota have been implemented to explore the interplay be- tween genetic variants, dietary intake, gut microbiome and metabolites in diabetes and its complications [65,103]. 10. Conclusions and Perspectives Metabolomic studies present the molecular characterization of diabetes and its com- plications and could elucidate underlying pathological pathways that are perturbed in a disease state. Metabolomics, especially using the untargeted approach, can provide a global metabolic snapshot and may identify previously unknown molecules that are involved in the development and progression of diabetes. Metabolomic studies, as mentioned above, have identi\ufb01ed biomarkers for the screening, diagnosis, and prediction of diabetes and its complications; some metabolites could also be biomarkers for monitoring the therapeutic effects of treatment. If being causal of a disease, the associated pathways could even be considered therapeutic targets. The integration of genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, or even clinical data in a systems approach may present a comprehensive metabolic network of cardiometabolic disease. In this regard, metabolomics is a powerful approach which can deepen the molecular understanding of and improve efforts towards preventing or improving clinical management of T2D and its complications.

Diabetes represents one of the most important global health problems. Approximately 90% of diabetics have type 2 diabetes. Identi \ufb01cation of effective screening markers is critical for early treatment and intervention that can delay and/or prevent complications associated with this chronic disease. Fortunately, metabolomics has introduced new insights into the pathology of diabetes as well as to predict disease onset and revealed new biomarkers to improve diagnostics in a range of diseases. Small-molecule metabolites havean important role in biological systems and represent attractive candidates to understand T2D phenotypes. Characteristic patterns of metabolites can be revealed that broaden our understanding of T2D disorder. This technique-driven review aims to demystify the mechanisms of T2D, to provide updates on the applications ofmetabolomics in addressing T2D with a focus on metabolites based biomarker discovery. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction Typical civilization diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), represent one of the most signi \ufb01cant global health problems because they are associated with a large economic burden on the health systems of many countries [1]. WHO predicted an estimated future number of 366 million affected individuals in 2030, which would be equivalent toa diabetes prevalence of 5% [2]. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is characterised by high blood glucose levels, which may be due ei- ther to the progressive failure of pancreatic b-cell function and consequently a lack of insulin production or to development of insulin resistance and subsequentl y the loss of b-cell function [3,4].Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2D. Improvement of risk prediction for T2D is crucial to the identi \ufb01cation of high-risk individuals who could bene \ufb01t from targeted preventive measures. Also, the burden of T2D is growing worldwide and a more desperate need for better tools to detect, diagnose and monitor the disease. Gold standard method for identifying patients with T2D is the oral glucose tolerance test [5]. However, this test is not widely used as a risk assessment tool because it is inconvenient, time-consuming, cost and has a poor speci \ufb01city. Fasting plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) are more widely used and less expensive, but they donot predict diabetes onset as accurately as an oral glucose tolerance test[6]. An additional shortcoming is its lack of sensitivity, resulting in late disease discovery and consequently the development of compli-cations at the time of diagnosis. To overcome this problem, researchers are hunting for new biomarkers that could be used to diagnose the ear- lier condition and single out individuals who are most likely to bene \ufb01tClinica Chimica Acta 429 (2014) 106 \u2013110 \u204eCorresponding authors.

The general procedure in which metabolomics was used for diagnosisand biomarker discovery is shown in Fig. 1 . Metabolomics offers potential advantages that classic diagnose approaches do not, basedon following discovery of a suite clinically relevant biomarker that are simultaneously affected by the T2D [12,13] . It may help in understanding the mechanism of T2D occurrence and progression onthe metabolic level and providing information for the identi \ufb01cation of early marker metabolites for T2D. Thus, in this mini-paper, particularattention will be paid to the past successes in applications of state-of- the-art technology on metabolomics to contribute to low-molecular- weight metabolites discovery in T2D research. 2. Metabolomics technologies Metabolomics has been increasingly applied to diagnosing diseases, measuring the response to treatment, discovering biomarkers, identify- ing perturbed pathways [14 \u201316]. Additionally, metabolomics can be seen as bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype, andidentifying novel changes in speci \ufb01c metabolites. Technological developments are the driving force behind advances in scienti \ufb01c knowledge. There are two major high-throughput tools consisting ofmass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy used in metabolomics study [17]. Both methods enable the comprehensive investigation of metabolic pro \ufb01les and can provide complementary snapshots of the metabolome of body \ufb02uids [18]. Ad- vantages of NMR spectroscopy include the nondestructive natureof the analysis, the robust and reproducible measurements and the minimal preparation requirements, as no separation or ionisation steps are necessary [19]. NMR analysis usually does not require anypretreatment, and enables the identi \ufb01cation of complex unidenti \ufb01ed metabolites [20]. MS is the most frequently used technique in metabolic studies with their high level of sensitivity, and often combined with other suitable methods for the analytical separation of compounds [21,22] . Because no single analytical method can accommodate the chemical diversity of the entire metabolome, therefore, a multiplatform approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding ofmet abolic alterations, and broaden the \u201cwindow \u201dof important metabolic variations [23,24] . 3. Metabolomic features of T2D T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function but currently it is dif \ufb01cult to determine the precise pathophys- iology in T2D patients. Insulin secretion from pancreatic \u03b2-cells is controlled by complex metabolic and energetic changes provoked by exposure to metabolic fuels. Perturbations in these processes lead to impaired insulin secretion, the ultimate cause of T2D. To increase our understanding of stimulus-secretion coupling and metabolic processes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of T2D, a comprehensive investigation of the metabolic response will be performed [25]. Metabolomics technologies have the potential for providing novelbiomarkers of disease and drug ef \ufb01cacy, and are increasingly being incorporated into biomarker exploration studies [26]. More speci \ufb01cally, metabolomics has a global and non-invasive analysis of biomarkers that are indicators of pathogenic process, or response to therapeutic intervention, thereby helping to monitor treatment response [27].

More speci \ufb01cally, metabolomics has a global and non-invasive analysis of biomarkers that are indicators of pathogenic process, or response to therapeutic intervention, thereby helping to monitor treatment response [27]. Recently, panels of multiple biomarkers re \ufb02ecting T2D pathologies have been developed. A variety of biomarkers representing various pathophysiological pathways of insulin resistance, have also been investigated [28]. The number of T2D patients has recently been increasing worldwide. Thus, the discovery of potential T2D biomarkers, leading to the earlydetection and/or prevention of diabetes mellitus, is strongly required. The term biomarker was de \ufb01ned by the National Institutes of Health as a \u201ccharacteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or phar- macologic responses to a therapeutic intervention \u201d. These include lipids, sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, organic acids, and many other low-molecular-weight compounds [29]. These small molecular metabolites could yield important information about a person's health or disease, Fig. 1. The general procedures in metabolomic can be used for biomarker discovery.107 A. Zhang et al. / Clinica Chimica Acta 429 (2014) 106 \u2013110 some of which may be molecular targets for therapeutic intervention [30]. Metabolomics in diabetes has provided researchers much knowl- edge and the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pathwaysand pathophysiological mechanisms. Several potential metabolic bio- markers and related metabolic pathways have been identi \ufb01ed and are currently being investigated and validated in T2D patients, such as 3-hydroxybutyrate with ketogenisis and altered bile acids [31]. Further- more, metabolomics studies conducted on human subjects between di- abetic patients and healthy controls revealed many important altered metabolic pathways and metabolic variations. Metabolomics increased our knowledge of the dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with progression of diseases and provided potentially new therapeutic strategies targeting these dysregulated pathways, though our under- standing about the distinct and complete metabolic footprints of T2D [32]. 4. Bringing metabolomics into T2D research Advantages of metabolomics over other \u201comics \u201d, include its high sensitivity and its ability to enable the analysis of relatively fewmetabolites compared with the unwieldy number of corresponding genes or mRNA molecules. There is mounting evidence that metabolo-mics can provide important insight into biomarker discoveries and the pathogenic nature of various diseases and a great deal of research on diabetes has been conducted with clinical human subjects during the last decade [33,34] . Given that the overall health status of an individual is captured by his or her metabolic state, metabolomics promises toimprove current, single metabolites-based clinical assessments by identifying metabolic signatures that embody global biochemical changes in disease. Metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools are being used to map potential biomarkers for T2D [35]. Application of metabolomics in T2D studies has rapidly evolved during the last decade and provides researchers the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pro \ufb01ling and pathophysiological mechanisms.

Thus, several metabolites were identi \ufb01ed to be related to T2D or insulin resistance and represent the basis for the identi \ufb01cation of novel diabetes biomarkers [36]. The accumulation of information from novel metabolomics technologies comes with substantial hope and expectations that these approaches will yield novel insights into T2D disease processes and that these insights will eventually translate into clinical applications that will pave the way for current medical routine to the ideal of personalized medicine. High-de \ufb01nition MS has been carried out to obtain comprehensive metabolite pro \ufb01ling and pathways of large biological data sets [7]. MS tends to have much higher analytical sensitivity, enables broader surveys of the metabolome, andcan be used to characterize metabolite data either in a targeted or nontargeted manner. Integration of metabolomics-based diagnostic principles into the T2D might be the direction to enable a revolution for future health care, also perhaps it is time to embrace the arrival of \u2018T2D-OMICS \u2019era. 5. Biomarkers and metabolomics studies on T2D Identi \ufb01cation of early biomarkers for prediction and monitoring is needed for adequate screening diagnostics of diabetes. A number of marker metabolites for diagnosis and prognosis of T2D have been reported. Metabolite pro \ufb01les of body \ufb02uids or tissues can be regarded as important indicators of physiological or pathological states, mayprovide a more comprehensive view of mechanisms in disease, and raise the possibility of identifying surrogate markers of T2D. Metabolomic discovery of biomarkers of T2D risk may reveal etiological pathways and help to identify individuals at risk. Floegel et al. had inves- tigated the association between serum metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics in the European cases of T2D [37]. MS used to quantify several metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids,hexose, and phospholipids, in serum samples, signi \ufb01cantly improvedT2D prediction. Surprisingly, metabolomics has revealed that branched- chain amino acids and related metabolites are more strongly associatedwith insulin resistance than many common lipid species [38].T h e branched-chain amino acids-related signature is predictive of incidentT2D and intervention outcomes and uniquely responsive to therapeutic interventions. Of note, Ha et al. reported that the receiver operating characteristic curve estimation suggested that decanoyl carnitine andlysoPC (C14:0) are the best metabolites for predicting the risk of developing T2D [39]. Phospholipids and their metabolisms are closely allied to nosogenesis and aggravation of T2D. Identi \ufb01cation of molecular components of potential biomarkers was performed on ion trap-MS[40]. As a result, 18 compounds with signi \ufb01cant regulation in patients compared with healthy controls were regarded as potential biomarkersfor T2D. Among them, 2 novel biomarkers, i.e., PI C18:0/22:6 and SM dC18:0/20:2, can be used to discriminate healthy individuals and T2D cases. Urinary metabolomes were analyzed to enhance understanding of the metabolic indicators of T2D disease pathogenesis and progression [41]. Urinary compounds signi \ufb01cantly increased in the T2D when compared with the normal group including glycine betaine, citric acid,kynurenic acid, glucose, and pipecolic acid. Wang et al. had"

Urinary compounds signi \ufb01cantly increased in the T2D when compared with the normal group including glycine betaine, citric acid,kynurenic acid, glucose, and pipecolic acid. Wang et al. had investigated whether metabolite pro \ufb01les could predict the development of diabetes [42]. Result showed that a combination of three amino acids couldpredict future diabetes. These \ufb01ndings underscore the potential role of amino acid metabolism in early T2D and suggest that amino acidpro\ufb01les could aid in diabetes risk assessment. A metabolomics approach was used to identify candidate biomarkers of T2D and revealed signi \ufb01cant metabolic variation, such as glycosylated hemoglobin levels, fasting glucose and insulin [43]. Three metabolites (glycine, lysophosphatidylcholine and acetylcarnitine) were identi \ufb01ed and signi \ufb01cantly altered levels and may help in developing novel strategies to prevent T2D. Understanding thebiochemical networks that underlie metabolic homeostasis and how they associate with insulin action will help unravel diabetes etiology. Fiehn et al. had examined differences in plasma concentrations of me- tabolites in fasted obese T2D vs. obese non-diabetic African-American women [44].I tr e \ufb02ects a close link between abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, amino acid catabolism, and ef \ufb01ciency of fuel combustion in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In a study, NMR-based metabolomic analysis in conjunction with multivariate statistics was applied toexamine the urinary metabolic changes in T2D [45]. It demonstrated profound changes in nucleotide metabolism, including that ofN-methylnicotinamide and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, which may provide unique biomarkers for following T2D progression. Suhre et al.\u2019 s study depicts the promising potential of metabolomics in diabetes research by identi \ufb01cation of a series novel and deregulated metabolites that associate with T2D [46]. Key perturbations of metabolic pathways were linked to kidney dysfunction, lipid metabolism, and interaction with the gut micro \ufb02ora (bile acids). Zhao et al. had investigated pathogenesis and pathogenic process of T2D byNMR-based metabonomics [47]. Principal components analysis on urine samples indicates markedly elevated levels of creatine/creatinine,dimethylamine, and acetoacetate, with concomitantly declined levels of citrate, 2-ketoglurarate, lactate, hippurate, and succinate compared with control rats, respectively. In a work, a metabonomic study was performed to determine metabolic variations associated with T2D patients [48]. Signi \ufb01cantly altered serum metabolites in T2D subjects include increased valine, maltose, glutamate, urate, butanoate andlong-chain fatty acid, and decreased glucuronolactone, lysine and lactate. The development of both glucose intolerances and insulin resistances is closely correlated with the progressive changes of human serum metabolome [49]. It provides useful information to bridge the gaps in understanding the metabolic alterations associatedwith the progression of glucose intolerances and insulin resistance status.

Here, Zhang et al. explored the differences in metabolite concentrations between T2D patients and healthy volunteers [12]. Biomarkers re\ufb02ected the biochemical events associated with early stages of T2D. These urinary differential metabolites were identi \ufb01ed involving several key metabolic pathways such as taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; cysteine and methionine metabolism; valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis metabolism, etc. It provides new insight into pathophysio- logic mechanisms and may enhance the understanding of its cause of disease. Analyzing metabolic differences between unperturbed and perturbed systems, such as healthy volunteers and patients with a disease, can lead to insights into the underlying pathology [51,52] .I n this review we take a closer look at the metabolomics used within the\ufb01eld of T2D. Furthermore, we highlight the most interesting metabolo- mics publications and discuss these in detail; additional studies arementioned as a reference for the interested reader. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives Metabolomics has the potential to generate novel noninvasive diagnostic tests, based on biomarkers of disease, which are simple and cost effective yet retain high sensitivity and speci \ufb01city characteristics. An early diagnosis of the disease or the identi \ufb01cation of those at risk has the potential of allowing more effective prevention programs and better treatment of the disease. T2D, called the burden of the twenty- \ufb01rst century, is growing with an epidemic rate. There is still a lack of reliable biomarkers indicative of metabolic alterations, highlightingthe need for the development of early diagnostic and prognostic markers for T2D. A deeper understanding of global perturbations in bio- chemical pathways could provide valuable insights about mechanisms of disease, prognostic, and diagnostic biomarkers. High-throughput metabolomics have provided insightful information on T2D disease development and onset prediction, and has revolutionized T2D research. Valuable information regarding T2D development, therapy and diagnosis can now be obtained with microliter sample volumes. Any\ufb01ndings associated with relevance to T2D, once passed to the clinical level, will be eventually combined with other diagnosisapproaches to hopefully reach the 100% detection level for high-risk patients.

The key features of NAFLD and nonal- coholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are described in Box 1. In Western countries, NAFLD has a prevalence of 20\u201340%, and NAFLD progresses to NASH in ~10\u201330% of affected patients1,2. Although NAFLD is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, there is currently no approved pharmacotherapy or approved biomarkers to readily assess disease progression and/or regression of NASH in response to a given treatment. According to the FDA, a biomarker is \u201ca defined characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or biological responses to an expo-sure or intervention, including therapeutic interven-tions\u201d 3. Although several studies have evaluated potential biomarkers, few have been validated and even fewer have been used in clinical practice. In addition, it is unknown whether relative differences in molecular biomarker con-centrations would be sufficient for diagnosis or prognosis of NASH. Moreover, the role of biomarker trajectories in individual patients is not clearly defined, and it is unknown whether monitoring these changes is essential for understanding their long-term outcome. NASH is a progressive disease that is histologically defined by the presence of hepatic fat (steatosis) with inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning, which can lead to further liver injury, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 4\u20137. The reference standard of assess - ment for treatment efficacy in NASH is liver histology8. Although hepatic decompensation or liver-related death are the hard clinical end points, owing to the difficulties of demonstrating drug efficacy based on these factors, \u2018likely\u2019 surrogate markers of these end points are accepted by regulatory bodies such as the FDA for provisional approval and are currently used to evaluate the outcome of clinical trials. These surrogate end points are histolog-ical: resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, and reduction in fibrosis without worsening of NASH 9. Although liver histology is currently the reference standard for the assessment of NASH progression and treatment efficacy, repeated liver biopsies are difficult to perform in patients with NASH because of health risk, sampling error, subjective variation in pathological inter - pretation, and cost 10. Currently, surrogate clinical param- eters are used to monitor response to treatment11\u201313, including circulating levels of aminotransferase activ- ities, elastography and non-invasive determination of Metabolomics and lipidomics in NAFLD: biomarkers and non-invasive diagnostic tests Mojgan Masoodi 1 \u2709, Amalia Gastaldelli 2, T uulia Hy\u00f6tyl\u00e4inen3, Enara Arretxe4, Cristina Alonso 4, Melania Gaggini2, Julia Brosnan5,12, Quentin M.

In this Review, we provide an overview of the contribution of metabolomics and lipidomics in clinical studies to identify biomarkers associated with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In addition, we highlight the key metabolic pathways in NAFLD and NASH that have been identified by metabolomics and lipidomics approaches and could potentially be used as biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostic tests.

However, there is still a great demand to estab- lish and validate other biomarkers that predict NASH progression and/or response to treatment. Based on this demand, the Innovative Medicines Initiative Consortium \u2018Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis\u2019 (IMI2 LITMUS) aims to develop, validate and advance towards qualification of biomarkers for testing NAFLD across a range of contexts of use. Different methodologies are consid- ered to be part of this aim, and metabolomics is one of these approaches. The metabolomics approach is a comprehensive biochemical profiling technique, built upon decades of fundamental research in biochemistry, physiology, analytical chemistry and bioinformatics. As the human plasma lipidome is enormously diverse and complex 14, lipidomics has emerged as a related subfield of metabolomics, aiming to comprehensively character - ize different molecular lipid species in biological systems as well as to investigate their function15. Metabolomics aims to assess metabolism and identify downstream functions of genes and proteins. The chemical and bio- logical diversity of the metabolome is enormous16. This diversity requires several analytical strategies, with an extensive array of techniques, to cover a wide range of metabolites while ensuring data output quality (Fig. 1). The advantages and limitations of different analytical approaches are summarized in TaBle 1.Genome-scale metabolic modelling has emerged as a powerful approach that can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of disease progression, and it has been used to attempt to identify biomarkers and underlying pathways for NAFLD\u2013NASH 17\u201319. Genome- scale metabolic models (GSMMs), as a scaffold, connect metabolic genes and their products (that is, enzymes) with metabolic pathways. Moreover, GSMMs can be constrained and contextualized with multi-\u2018omics\u2019 data - sets, thereby connecting an organism\u2019s genotype to its phenotype. Using GSMMs one can study changes in the global metabolic network topology, evaluate metabolite flux distribution, and predict uptake and secretion of specific metabolites 20.

In this Review, we evaluate the use of metabolomics and lipidomics, in clinical studies to identify biomark-ers associated with NAFLD and NASH. Owing to some overlaps between NASH and other metabolic disorders such as T2DM, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance, it is worth mentioning that some of the investigated biomarkers are associated with other aspects of meta-bolic disorders. Here, we focus on the metabolites that are reported to be associated with diagnosis, prognosis and progression of NAFLD and NASH. This discussion includes metabolomics studies that found any associa- tions between these metabolites and disease pathology and clinical outcome, as well as those metabolites that are associated with disease progression or improve- ment following clinical intervention or treatment of NASH. Most metabolomics analyses have been con-ducted on plasma samples obtained after an overnight fast. We present the key metabolic pathways that have been identified in NAFLD\u2013NASH through metabolo- mics approaches and that could potentially be used as biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostic tests. Metabolomics and amino acids in NAFLD An association between circulating amino acids and ste-atohepatitis has been found in several clinical studies 21\u201325. An impairment in amino acid metabolism in NAFLD is linked to insulin resistance, particularly in muscle cells, in which protein metabolism and amino acid concen-trations are regulated by insulin, which inhibits protein catabolism and amino acid release during fasting and promotes glucose uptake as well as protein synthesis in the postprandial state 26 (Fig. 2). Insulin resistance, com- monly defined as an impaired insulin action, results in increased insulin secretion and circulating insulin con-centration to achieve similar metabolic effects compared with insulin-sensitive individuals. An insulin-resistant state is often associated with increased fasting concen- tration of essential amino acids in circulation due to increased muscle protein catabolism despite high insulin concentrations 27,28 and impaired amino acid catabolism in both liver and adipose tissue29. Patients with NAFLD often exhibit an imbalance between protein synthesis and protein catabolism, leading to sarcopenia30. Moreover, obesity, a well-known insulin-resistant state, is associated with increased fasting amino acid levels, in particular branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) 23,31,32. However, there is some inconsistency in the identified patterns and levels of amino acids in patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH.Key points \u2022 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFlD) affects 25% of the adult world population; in about 20% of patients, it can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to cirrhosis. \u2022 There is an urgent need for development of clinically relevant biomarkers and non-invasive diagnostic tests for NAFlD. \u2022 metabolomics and lipidomics approaches have provided insightful evidence of altered metabolic pathways in NAFlD and NASH. \u2022 There is an association between circulating amino acids and steatohepatitis, and impairment in amino acid metabolism in NAFlD is strongly correlated with insulin resistance, particularly in the muscle. \u2022 An increase in oxidative stress results in a reduction in hepatic glutathione levels and is associated"

BCAAs (leu- cine, isoleucine and valine) are among the most stud- ied amino acids, and, because they are essential (that is, not produced by human cells), their increased fast-ing concentrations in plasma reflect a catabolic state and often insulin resistance 23,33. Kalhan et al.21 exam- ined the fasting-state plasma metabolomes in a group of individuals with biopsy-proven steatosis ( n = 11) and steatohepatitis (n = 24) but without diabetes, and compared them with the metabolomes in a group of healthy individuals (n = 25) to identify biomarkers associated with steatosis and NASH. The levels of cir - culating BCAAs and of phenylalanine, glutamate and aspartate were higher in patients with NASH than in healthy individuals. However, BCAA levels were not significantly higher in patients with steatosis than in healthy individuals 21. These patterns of change in lev- els of circulating BCAAs were also confirmed in liver biopsy samples from healthy individuals (n = 17), and from patients with steatosis (n = 4), NASH with steatosis (n = 14) and NASH without steatosis (n = 23)22. Human liver tissue samples were analysed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics to char - acterize BCAA liver profiles in the progressive stages of NAFLD 22. The study showed a significant increase (P \u2264 0.05) in the levels of BCAAs, tyrosine and phenyla- lanine during the transition from steatosis to NASH (in patients with NASH both with and without steatosis) 22.

Qi et al. were able to distinguish steatosis from NASH on the basis of the metabolic profiles of serum samples from 38 patients with steatosis and 21 patients with NASH using MS-based metabolomics 34. They identified glu- tamate, l-glutamine and pyroglutamate from among five main metabolites able to distinguish simple stea-tosis from NASH, with changes of 1.80-fold, 1.81-fold and 2.26-fold, respectively 34. They further assessed the quantitative serum levels of pyroglutamate and found higher levels in patients with NASH (7.89 mmol/l; 95% CI 5.35\u201310.41 mmol/l) than in patients with steatosis (3.57 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.98\u20137.34 mmol/l) or a healthy control group (1.48 mmol/l; 95% CI 0.48\u20133.97 mmol/l)34. Notably, the cohort sizes in both studies were small, and they used two different biofluids (plasma and serum), which might explain the differences in identified metabolites distinguishing NASH from simple steato-sis. In another clinical study from the outpatient clinic of Shuguang Hospital, China, including 33 patients with NAFLD and 45 patients with NASH, the researchers per - formed urinary MS-based metabolomics and found ele-vated levels of citrulline, arginine and valine in patients with NAFLD compared with the levels in healthy indi- viduals, and higher urinary levels of lysine, valine, citrul-line, arginine, threonine, tyrosine and leucine in patients with NASH than in healthy individuals. However, when comparing urinary amino acid and related metabo- lites, only pyroglutamic acid could distinguish between NAFLD and NASH 35. Kakazu et al. examined the correlation between hepatocyte lipid droplet heterogeneity and circulat-ing BCAA levels in 80 patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH and observed a positive association between plasma BCAA levels and maximum area of lipid droplets in the liver 24. They further observed that a diet high in BCAAs induced heterogeneity in the lipid droplets in a mouse model of NAFLD and proposed that some BCAAs could potentially modulate the size and heterogeneity of lipid droplets in hepatocytes in patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH. They concluded that supplementation with BCAAs could potentially be useful for advanced-stage NAFLD but not for early-stage NAFLD 24. Indeed, a 48-week supplementation with BCAAs in patients with cirrhosis ameliorated hypoalbuminaemia, maintained skeletal muscle mass and decreased muscle fat, and improved glucose sensitivity, all factors that might contribute to improving the survival of these patients 36. Lehmann et al. applied a targeted IDQ metabolomics platform (Biocrates) to differentiate insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive subgroups in 40 patients with NAFLD at baseline and following a 9-month lifestyle interven-tion, referred to as the Tuebingen lifestyle intervention programme (TULIP) 37, by measuring plasma levels of 180 metabolites38. They identified seven metabolites, including leucine, isoleucine and ornithine, that discrim-inated insulin-sensitive from insulin-resistant patients with NAFLD, with a high discriminatory power both at baseline and following lifestyle intervention (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) 0.77 at baseline (positive predictive value 0.75, negative predictive value 0.88, sensitivity 0.90, specificity 0.70); AUROC 0.80 at follow-up (positive predictive value 0.83, negative predictive value 0.77, sensitivity 0.75, specific- ity 0.85)) 38.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive disease histologically defined by the presence of hepatic fat (steatosis) with inflammation and hepatocellular ballooning, and can lead to further liver injury, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma 4\u20137. A number of classification systems for histological severity of NAFlD and NASH have been proposed. The most commonly used in clinical trials are NAS (NAFlD activity score) and SAF (steatosis, activity, fibrosis). The NAS scoring system comprises four histological features that are evaluated semiquantitatively: steatosis (0\u20133), lobular inflammation (0\u20132), hepatocellular ballooning (0\u20132) and fibrosis (0\u20134) 186. lipotoxicity is one of the key components of NASH, which leads to toxic lipid accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell injury and chronic inflammation. Hepatic steatosis is mainly caused by an imbalance between intrahepatic triglyceride production and secretion. An excess of triglyceride content in NAFlD is associated with alterations in both adipose tissue and hepatic lipid metabolism, including increased rates of adipose tissue lipolysis, hepatic de novo lipogenesis and vlDl secretion66,67. NATure revIeWS | GASTROeNTeROLOG y & HePATOLOG yReviews volume 18 | December 2021 | 837 0123456789();: found that higher baseline fasting concentrations of the BCAAs leucine, isoleucine and valine and of the aro- matic amino acids (AAAs) tyrosine and phenylalanine were significantly associated with the risk of develop-ing T2DM 32. They observed that fasting plasma levels of these amino acids were elevated at baseline when individuals were normoglycaemic, and their increase was associated with an up to fourfold increased risk of future diabetes 32. These findings were then validated in an independent cohort. AAAs, in particular phe- nylalanine and its metabolite tyrosine, are frequently found to be decreased in patients with liver disease39, whereas BCAAs are increased, mainly because of insu- lin resistance29. However, as liver disease progresses, the opposite is often observed: high AAAs and reduced BCAAs, especially in patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency 40,41, which occurs mainly because of an impairment in hepatic amino acid catabolism40\u201342.

Thus, a low ratio of BCAA to AAA (known as Fischer\u2019s ratio) has been used to identify patients with more severe liver disease41. A simplified version of Fischer\u2019s ratio that uses only tyrosine as the denominator has been shown to be a prognostic factor for early HCC43. Notably, whereas BCAAs are mainly catabolized in muscle and adipose tissue 29, AAA metabolism occurs mainly in the liver44. Most previous studies in which upregulated BCAAs were found, however, mainly included individuals with obesity and insulin resistance, and it is therefore not easy to establish whether increased fasting con-centrations of amino acids are related to NAFLD or to peripheral insulin resistance. Newgard et al. have shown that BCAAs, methionine, glutamate to glutamine ratio, and the AAAs phenylalanine and tyrosine contribute to distinguishing individuals with obesity from lean individuals 29. A difference in amino acid concentrations in patients with NASH between those with and without obesity was also observed by Gaggini et al.23. Moreover, BCAA levels were strongly correlated with homeosta-sis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Gaggini et al. addressed this question in patients with NAFLD by evaluating amino acid concentrations using quantitative gas chromatography MS (GC\u2013MS) metabo- lomics and the association with fasting insulin resistance in 44 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD without dia-betes with obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2, n = 15) and without obesity (BMI <30 kg/m2, n = 29)23. Patients with NAFLD had increased glucose production (hepatic insulin resistance measured using tracers) and reduced glucose uptake (peripheral insulin resistance) despite high insu-lin concentrations compared with control individuals without NAFLD 23. These authors also observed elevated levels of fasting glutamate, alanine, valine and isoleucine (but not leucine) in patients with NAFLD compared with the levels in individuals without NAFLD. In addition, patients with NAFLD and obesity showed increased levels of tyrosine and lysine compared with individuals without NAFLD. Interestingly, they observed that most amino acids increased with hepatic insulin resistance, whereas only tyrosine levels correlated with peripheral insulin resistance 23.

A positive correlation between BCAA levels and hepatic and/or peripheral insulin resistance was also observed in a cohort of 111 healthy individuals with over - weight or obesity and mild hepatic steatosis45. Moreover, BCAAs and tyrosine levels were positively associated with intrahepatic fat content after adjusting for age, gen- der, BMI and HOMA-IR 45. In another clinical study in patients with NASH (137 patients with stage 0\u20134 fibro- sis), plasma BCAA levels decreased with increasing liver fibrosis, and tyrosine levels increased with increasing fibrotic stage 46, consistent with the findings of previ- ous studies42,43. However, reduced AAA or increased BCAA levels were previously observed in patients with other chronic severe liver diseases (that is, chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis or crypto-genic cirrhosis), which is possibly related to an altered insulin\u2013glucagon ratio 29,39. Amino acids are also used as an energy substrate and are oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for the production of ATP (Fig. 2). Kahl et al.47 evaluated the association between circulating levels of amino acids and hepatic phosphorus metabolism, measured in vivo using 31P/1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), in 62 insulin-sensitive volunteers without diabetes or obe-sity. Plasma BCAA concentrations, particularly leucine, were positively associated with \u03b3ATP , and the correlation remained after adjusting for BMI, age and sex, whereas no correlation was found between \u03b3ATP and indexes of insulin resistance or steatosis, probably because in these individuals insulin resistance and intrahepatic triglycerides were low 47. As mentioned above, there is inconsistency in the levels and patterns of reported circulating amino acids in patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH, which is difficult to explain on the basis of currently available information. However, we can speculate about several factors that could potentially explain this discrepancy, including small sample sizes of patients with NAFLD, and differ - ences in analytical methodology, applied quantitative methods, and characterization of patients with NAFLD\u2013 NASH, especially with respect to BMI, insulin resist- ance and degree of fibrosis.

Pathway analysis performed using urine samples from 108 individuals (30 individ- uals as controls, 33 patients with NAFLD or steatosis and normal liver function, and 45 patients with NASH and abnormal liver function) revealed that in addition to pathways of energy metabolism and amino acid metab- olism, the pentose phosphate pathway might also be involved in the progression from NAFLD to NASH35. In fact, HbA1c was increased in patients with NAFLD or NASH compared with healthy individuals35. Amino acids and glutathione metabolism. Several studies have suggested that an increase in oxidative stress in the liver is associated with liver damage and the progression of NAFLD to NASH. The increase in oxidative stress results in consumption of the major intracellular anti- oxidant, glutathione, and consequently a reduction in hepatic glutathione levels 7. The amino acids involved in the synthesis and catabolism of glutathione are gluta- mate, cysteine and glycine, but methionine and serine, being precursors of cysteine, are also involved. Zhou et al. performed MS-based metabolomics on 318 patients who had undergone a liver biopsy because of suspected NASH. They found increased levels of cir - culating glutamate and isoleucine, and decreased levels of glycine and serine, in patients with NASH51. They also developed a MS-based model score for NASH and com- pared its diagnostic performance with scores based on routinely available data and the patatin-like phospho-lipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) rs738408 geno-type. They used backward stepwise logistic regression analyses of variables from clinical data and metabolo- mics to develop the NASH ClinLipMet score. The best scoring system was achieved using five metabolites, con-sisting of three amino acids (glutamate, isoleucine and glycine) and two lipids (lysophosphatidylcholine LPC 16:0 and phosphatidylethanolamine PE 40:6), and clini-cal data such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fast-ing insulin and PNPLA3 genotype.

The NASH ClinLipMet score identified patients with NASH with higher accuracy than the clinical or metabolic profiling data alone 51. Dasarathy and colleagues assessed the kinetics and rate of glycine oxidation and ureagenesis in healthy indi-viduals (n = 8) and in patients with NASH (n = 6) at the basal level and in response to an intravenous infusion of intralipid which leads to increased plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) 52. Although there were no statistically significant differences in the concentrations of glycine, cysteine, urea and oxidation of glycine in patients with NASH compared with the concentrations in healthy individu-als at basal levels, plasma glutathione levels increased in patients with NASH in response to intralipid infusion and had a higher contribution to serine to biosynthe- sis of cystathionine. The researchers concluded that as plasma glutathione is mostly derived from the liver, this increase might be due to increased glutathione synthe- sis as a result of the elevated oxidative stress caused by higher fatty acid oxidation in patients with NASH 52. Methionine is the source of cysteine, the precursor of glutathione53. Using stable isotope tracer infusion in 15 patients with NASH and 19 healthy age-matched individuals as controls, Kalhan et al. measured the kinetics of methionine and its transmethylation and transsulfuration, finding lower rates of methylation of homocysteine and transmethylation of methionine in patients with NASH, whereas the rate of transsulfura- tion of methionine was similar to that in the control group 53. They also confirmed their previous findings that there are no significant differences in fasting plasma concentrations of total cysteine, homocysteine and glu- tathione between healthy individuals and patients with NASH 52,53. However, in response to enteral protein load, they found a statistically significant decrease in total cysteine and increase in total homocysteine in the plasma of healthy individuals; a statistically significant increase in plasma homocysteine concentration after the meal, but no change in plasma total cysteine concentra- tion, was observed in the NASH group, while plasma levels of glutathione were similar in the two groups 53. The researchers speculated that the activity of methio - nine adenosyltransferase (MAT), the enzyme respon-sible for S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) synthesis, was reduced in patients with NASH owing to the oxidative stress caused by increased fatty acid oxidation, resulting in a lower rate of transmethylation reactions 53. SAMe is the source of essentially all methyl transfer reactions in cells, which regulate key biological processes such as VLDL synthesis and export, gene expression and redox homeostasis 54,55. Thus an impairment in SAMe synthesis favours NAFLD. Increased plasma levels of homocyst- eine, cysteine and cysteinylglycine were also found in 64 children with biopsy-proven NAFLD compared with the levels in age-matched healthy children.

In addition, circulating glutathione levels were decreased in children with NAFLD compared with the control group 56.Fig. 2 | Overview of the key metabolic pathways in fasting and postprandial states involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. a | During fasting, the liver is the main source of glucose, which is produced by glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis for amino acids (released by the muscle), lactate and/or glycerol (released together with fatty acids by the adipose tissue during lipolysis). Glucogenic amino acids include alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, methionine, proline, serine and valine. Leucine and lysine are ketogenic, whereas phenylalanine, isoleucine, threonine, tryptophan and tyrosine are both glucogenic and ketogenic. Amino acids are also involved in the synthesis of ceramides and sphingomyelins (SMs). Fatty acids that are taken up by the liver are either oxidized to produce energy and ketone bodies (for example, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) or to be re-esterified to diglycerides (DGs) and triglycerides (TGs). Newly synthesized triglycerides can be stored as lipid droplets or be secreted as VLDL. Glutamate, glycine, cysteine and serine are used for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH) in response to oxidative stress. b | In the postprandial state, insulin decreases hepatic glucose production and stimulates glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) is stimulated by carbohydrate (mainly fructose) and insulin. Dietary fats are absorbed as chylomicrons. Primary bile acids (synthesized in the liver from cholesterol) are secreted in response to the meal to facilitate the digestion of fats. Dietary amino acids and fatty acids are taken up by the liver but also by muscle (amino acids for protein synthesis) and adipose tissue (fatty acids for triglycerides).

Mat1a-knockout mice have chronically low hepatic SAMe levels and impaired synthesis and release of VLDL, which leads to the intrahepatic accumulation of lipids and oxidized fatty acids, oxidative stress, and abnormal hepatic and serum lipid signatures, which trigger the spontaneous development of steatosis and its progression to NASH, fibrosis and HCC58.

Nearly half of the patients showed a phenocopy that matched this Mat1a-knockout lipidomic signature 58. Integration of other omics data might improve this novel subtyping approach in patients with NAFLD, enabling further interpretation of the complex biochemical processes and the heterogeneity of the disease, opening the door to the development of precision NASH treatments 54. Betaine (N ,N,N-trimethylglycine) is a product of choline oxidation and provides an alternative pathway for methylation of homocysteine 53. Circulating betaine levels were decreased in patients with NAFLD and neg- atively correlated with histological severity including inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis59; these results are interesting because, although the mechanisms are still to be elucidated, in animal studies betaine supplementation seems to protect against high-fat-diet-induced NAFLD60. Mardinoglu et al. used a combination of GSMM and MS-based metabolomics in 86 individuals with varying degrees of hepatic steatosis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of NAFLD 18. They observed lower fasting plasma levels of glycine, serine, betaine and N-acetylglycine in individuals with a high degree of steatosis than in those with a low degree of steatosis, as well as a negative correlation between the plasma levels of these metabolites and hepatic steatosis. However, they did not observe any correlation between hepatic steatosis and the plasma levels of cysteine and glutamine, which are also required for the synthesis of glutathione 18. Furthermore, they assessed the effects of short-term dietary supplementation with serine (each patient received one oral dose of ~20 g of l -serine (200 mg/kg/day) for 14 days) on hepatic steatosis and liver functions in six patients with a high degree of hepatic steatosis18. After supplementation with serine they observed statistically significant decreases in plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, alkaline phosphatase and hepatic steatosis (decreases between 1% and 23%), but not in plasma levels of triglycerides 18. Glutamate and glutamine. Glutamate has a central role in hepatic amino acid metabolism, as it is one of the major substrates for the synthesis of glutathione but also because it is involved in the transdeamination and/or catabolism of most amino acids, which gives rise to glutamate 23. Glutamine and glutamate are also involved in nitrogen metabolism and ammonia production. Glutamine is quantitatively the most common nitrogen transporter between tissues. Glutamine metabolism is altered in liver disease, and glutaminolysis TCA cycle intermediates increase with fibrosis severity in patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD even after accounting for potential confounders such as age, sex and severity of the metabolic syndrome 21,23,61. Glutamate is also involved in the synthesis of \u03b3-glutamyl dipeptides that are produced by the conjugation of glutamate with other amino acids in the \u03b3-glutamyl cycle.

These compounds were found to be increased in patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH com-pared with levels in healthy individuals 21. Similar results were observed by Soga et al., who measured \u03b3-glutamyl dipeptides by capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight MS metabolomics in 248 serum samples from healthy individuals as controls (n = 53) and patients with vari- ous liver injuries including simple steatosis (n = 9) and NASH ( n = 11) 62. They found increases in the levels of \u03b3-glutamyl dipeptides in patients with liver injuries, including NAFLD and NASH. In addition, they found that the glutamyl dipeptide levels decreased during liver disease progression (and were lower in patients with NASH than in those with simple steatosis), indicating that an increase in oxidative stress is required for met- abolic reprogramming of hepatic stellate cells and liver fibrogenesis, at least in mice 61. Another study showed that carbon tetrachloride- treated mice with liver fibrosis have decreased glu-tamine and increased glutamate levels in both serum and liver tissue. Moreover, the glutamate to glutamine ratio in the liver was positively correlated with the severity of myofibroblast accumulation and fibro- sis and with the glutamate to glutamine ratio in the serum 61. Glutamate, the glutamate to glutamine ratio and \u03b1-ketoglutarate are associated with the decline in glutathione production18,21,23,62,63. In another study, MS-based metabolomics analysis of plasma samples was performed in patients with NASH who responded to vitamin E treatment (n = 16) and those who did not (n = 15) 64 to identify metabolic profiles that are reflec- tive of histological improvement at the end of treatment. Lower circulating levels of \u03b3-glutamylated amino acids including \u03b3-glutamyl leucine, \u03b3-glutamyl isoleucine and \u03b3-glutamyl valine were associated with histolog-ical improvement in response to vitamin E, and the authors speculated that this association was indicative of decreased glutathione turnover and improved systemic oxidative stress 64. Gaggini et al. introduced a new index using amino acids (glutamic acid, glycine and serine) that are involved in glutathione synthesis (GSG index = glutamate/(ser - ine + glycine)) and examined the association between the GSG index and alterations in liver histology in patients with biopsy-proven NASH compared with individuals without NAFLD 23. The researchers observed a strong association between the GSG index and liver enzymes including ALT and AST but especially \u03b3\u2010glutamyltrans- ferase.

Lipidomics in NAFLD\u2013NASH Our understanding of lipid metabolism and the meta- bolic pathways that contribute to lipotoxicity in NASH has improved considerably owing to advances in lipi- domics. Hepatic steatosis, which is an important com - ponent of NAFLD and NASH, is mainly caused by an imbalance between intrahepatic triglyceride pro- duction and secretion. Hepatic steatosis arises when hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and fatty acid uptake from the circulation saturate the capacity of the liver to oxidize fatty acids and secrete triglycerides in the form of VLDL 66\u201368 (Fig. 2). Assessing fatty acid flux is a well-established method to understand lipid metab-olism, which includes profiling non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and esterified fatty acids into several lipid classes, including glycerolipids, phospholipids, sphingolipids and cholesterol esters. Fatty acids and oxidized fatty acids. The main structural components of complex lipids are fatty acids that are introduced via the diet, released by adipose tissue dur - ing lipolysis, or synthesized via DNL in the liver (Fig. 2). Donnelly et al. measured triglyceride composition in the liver of patients with NAFLD, and demonstrated that most of the fatty acids in triglycerides arise from NEFAs released by adipose tissue (59%), whereas only 15% arise from the diet and 26% from DNL 69. This result is in agreement with those of other studies, showing that adipose tissue insulin resistance that results in high lipolysis and NEFA release in the circulation is the most important metabolic defect in patients with NAFLD, regardless of the presence of obesity 70, and is associated with increased liver fibrosis71\u201373. Improvement in adipose tissue insulin resistance, for example after treatment with pioglitazone, is associated with a reduction in liver fibrosis in patients with NASH73,74. The first step of DNL is the synthesis of palmitic acid (C16:0), which is a saturated fatty acid (SFA). Palmitic acid can be incorporated into other lipids (for example, triglycerides, diacylglycerols, ceramides and phospho-lipids), elongated to stearic acid (C18:0) or desaturated to palmitoleic acid (C16:1n-7). Stearoyl\u2010coenzyme A desaturase 1, one of the key enzymes and rate\u2010lim - iting steps in DNL, desaturates stearic and palmitic acids into oleic acid (C18:1n-9) and palmitoleic acid, respectively 75, which are the most abundant fatty acids found in phospholipids, cholesterol esters and triglycer - ides as well as VLDL particles76,77. Puri et al. performed lipidomics analysis on liver biopsy samples from patients with NAFLD, NASH and healthy individuals (n = 9 per group) 78. Profiling of NEFAs showed no significant difference in the levels of stearic acid, oleic acid, pal-mitic acid and palmitoleic acid between patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH and the control group, although the total levels of hepatic SFA and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increased significantly in patients with NAFLD and"

Profiling of NEFAs showed no significant difference in the levels of stearic acid, oleic acid, pal-mitic acid and palmitoleic acid between patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH and the control group, although the total levels of hepatic SFA and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) increased significantly in patients with NAFLD and NASH compared with the control group. The authors also observed a significant decrease in the levels of \u03b3-linolenic acid (C18:3n-6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) in patients with NASH 78. Kalhan et al. observed a significant reduction in several NEFAs, including eicosapentaenoate (C20:5n-3), docosahex - aenoate (C22:6n-3), 10-undecenoate (C11:1n-1) and arachidonic acid in patients with NASH compared with the control group 21. By contrast, only caprate (C10:0) and 10-undecenoate were significantly lower in patients with steatosis than in healthy individuals. Only linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) and undecanoic acid (C11:0) were sig-nificantly higher in patients with steatosis than in those with NASH 21. The increment in the dietary intake of \u03c9-6 PUFA in the past few decades has led to an increase in the \u03c9-6 to \u03c93 ratio, which predisposes to NAFLD development 79. A reduction in the \u03c9-6 to \u03c9-3 ratio was found to be ben- eficial for steatosis in animal models80,81. Consumption of dietary \u03c9-6 fatty acids also contribute to NASH development, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction by disrupting mitochondrial respiratory chain and cell death, in mice 82. Consistent with this, Puri et al. found an increased hepatic \u03c9-6 to \u03c9-3 ratio (P < 0.05) in patients with NASH ( n = 9) compared with patients with steato- sis (n = 9) and the control group (n = 9)78. \u03c9-6 and \u03c9-3 fatty acids can be oxidized via lipoxygenases (LOXs) or cyclooxygenases (COXs) or through non-enzymatic pathways to generate oxylipins83. The circulating levels of oxidized arachidonic acid were evaluated in 50 lean healthy individuals, and in 25 patients with overweight or obesity with steatosis, and in 50 patients with overweight or obesity with NASH 84. Interestingly, no difference in the levels of COX products of arachidonic acid (mainly prostaglan- dins and thromboxane A2) was observed, whereas the levels of LOX metabolites 5S -hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), 8-HETE and 15-HETE progres- sively increased from healthy individuals to patients with NAFLD to patients with NASH, and 11-HETE was significantly increased in patients with NASH only 84. Increases in the levels of 5-HETE, 9-HETE, 11-HETE, 12-HETE and 15-HETE in patients with NASH have also been reported, although the significant changes were limited to patients with morbid obesity (BMI >30 kg/m 2)25. Arachidonic acid-derived oxidized products generated from 5-LOX, 12-LOX and 15-LOX pathways have also been assessed as non-invasive NASH biomarkers. Although the study was performed in a small cohort (ten patients with biopsy-proven NAFL and nine patients with biopsy-proven NASH), the results also revealed higher levels of these compounds in patients with NAFL than in patients with NASH 85. The research- ers highlighted 11,12-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-diHETrE) as the best candidate for non-invasive discrimination between NAFL and NASH, as it showed an AUROC of 1.

In 2020, Caussy et al. also found that plasma levels of 11,12-diHETE, tetranor-12-HETE, adrenic acid and 14,15-diHETE were positively associated with fibro- sis stage in a cohort of 427 patients with biopsy-proven NATure revIeWS | GASTROeNTeROLOG y & HePATOLOG yReviews volume 18 | December 2021 | 843 0123456789();: NAFLD86. The researchers also performed a longitudinal study of circulating eicosanoid levels in 63 patients with NASH and significant fibrosis (stage 2 or 3) in a phase II clinical trial of 24 weeks. They identified a combination of eicosanoids and PUFAs that predicted liver fibrosis improvement (one or more stages) with an AUROC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.62\u20130.87) 86. Feldstein et al. found that the non-enzymatically derived oxylipins 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), 13-HODE, 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxoODE) and 13-oxoODE were significantly elevated in patients with NASH ( n = 37) compared with patients with steatosis (n = 23) or individuals with normal liver biopsy (n = 13) 87. On the basis of these results, the researchers generated a risk score for NASH (oxNASH), including the 13-HODE to linoleic acid ratio, age, BMI and AST, which was able to detect NASH with an AUROC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.73\u20130.93) in the training cohort (n = 73 patients) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.60\u20130.88) in the validation cohort (n = 49 patients) 87. A study performed in adolescents with obesity also revealed an association between 9-HODE, 13-HODE, 9-oxo-ODE and 13-oxo-ODE and caspase-cleaved cytokeratin 18 fragment (CK-18), a biomarker of liver injury, in patients with steatosis, independent of age, sex, z-score BMI or ethnicity 88. The authors also hypothesized that the association between these compounds and liver injury might be driven by the PNPLA3 rs738409 single-nucleotide polymorphism, and that they might have a harmful effect on insulin secre-tion, as patients with impaired glucose tolerance showed higher levels of these oxidized fatty acids 88. Changes in the levels of circulating oxylipins were also evaluated in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for evaluation of pentoxifylline in patients with NASH (n = 47, 21 treated with pentox- ifylline and 26 receiving a placebo) 89. The effects of the drug included a significant reduction in the circulating levels of several oxidized fatty acids and, remarkably, a significant correlation between improved histological fibrosis scores and reduced HODEs and oxoODEs, as well as a correlation between improvement in lobular inflammation and decreased levels of HETEs 89.

There is also some evidence of a potential role for specialized pre-resolving mediators in the resolution of NASH and fibrosis 90. Despite the valuable results of these studies, most were performed in small cohorts and were not vali-dated. Therefore, large, multicentre clinical trials are needed to evaluate the precision and robustness of the use of biomarkers based on oxidized fatty acids as non-invasive biomarkers of NASH. Nevertheless, one of the challenges of using oxylipins as diagnostic markers is their stability in biological samples (they can be pro-duced rapidly). Sampling and sample handling could have a major effect on the reported concentrations of these lipids, thereby potentially limiting their clinical use in diagnostic assays. Triglycerides, phospholipids and sphingolipids. Elevation in peripheral fatty acid flux and DNL was demon-strated in patients with NAFLD 69. An increase in the levels of molecular species of triglycerides containing fatty acids with a low carbon number and a double bond (that is, shorter-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids) was observed in patients with NAFLD in sev-eral studies 68,77,91,92. Interestingly, this pattern of changes in triglycerides has also been found in metabolic dis- orders, especially those associated with insulin resist- ance such as obesity93,94. Moreover, decreased levels of triglycerides containing PUFAs, including \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 fatty acids, have also been found in patients with NAFL and NASH78,92. However, the \u03c9-6 to \u03c9-3 ratio in triglyc- erides was elevated in patients with NASH and NAFL compared with the ratio in the control group78. Given the relevance of triglyceride content to the development of NAFLD and NASH, several studies were performed to assess the potential of using these lipids as biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of NAFLD. BMI-dependent lipidomic profiles associated with NAFLD and NASH were described in plasma samples from a cohort of 467 patients (90 with nor - mal liver, 246 with steatosis and 131 with NASH) 25. Several lipid classes, particularly sphingolipids, were reported to be differentially altered in NASH and stea - tosis depending on the BMI subgroup. However, apart from these obesity-dependent changes, the differences in glycerolipid levels were found to be similar across all the BMI subgroups: triglyceride concentrations were higher in patients with steatosis than in patients with normal liver, whereas the abundance of several triglyc-eride species was decreased in patients with NASH compared with those with steatosis 25. On the basis of these findings in a cohort of 467 patients, Mayo et al. reported a test consisting of 28 triglyceride species split into two panels: 11 triglyceride species were able to dis-tinguish between NAFLD and normal liver, although without discriminatory power between NASH and steatosis; and 20 triglyceride species were able to dis- criminate between NASH and steatosis, although not between normal liver and NASH 95.

The test is a two-step BMI-dependent logistic regression algorithm that dis- criminates firstly between normal liver and NAFLD, and secondly between steatosis and NASH. Mayo et al. also included an independent and multicentre cohort of 192 patients (7 with normal liver, 109 with steatosis and 76 with NASH, based on liver biopsy) and demon- strated that the test was able to discriminate between normal liver and NAFLD (AUROC 0.90 \u00b1 0.02 in the original cohort, 0.88 \u00b1 0.05 in the validation cohort) and between steatosis and NASH (AUROC 0.95 \u00b1 0.01 in the original cohort, 0.79 \u00b1 0.04 in the validation cohort) 95. Notably, the performance of the test remained constant in the range of 25\u201360 kg/m2, although the error rate in NASH diagnosis was dependent on glucose concentra-tion: the test performed better in patients with glucose levels <136 mg/dl (AUROC 0.81 \u00b1 0.04) 95. Bril et al. also evaluated this test in 220 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for the discrimination between steatosis and NASH and found an AUROC of 0.79 (95% CI 0.68\u20130.90) in patients with glycated haemoglobin <53 mmol/mol and AUROC 0.87 (95% CI 0.76\u20130.97) in patients with HOMA-IR <3 (reF.96). However, the test performed less well in patients with high insulin resistance or poor glycaemic control96. www.nature.com/nrgastroReviews 844 | December 2021 | volume 18 0123456789();: Serum levels of intact lipids, including phospholipids, sphingolipids and triglycerides, were measured using LC\u2013MS-based lipidomics in 679 well-characterized patients with NAFLD to identify blood markers for prediction of NAFLD and liver fat content 97. Liver fat content was also measured using 1H-MRS in 54% of the participants (n = 369) and using a liver biopsy in the remaining 46%. The authors divided the lipid data into nine lipid clusters and observed an overall significant increase in the levels of triglycerides containing fatty acids with a low carbon number and double bond count as well as generally lower concentrations of lysophos- pholipids and ether lipids in patients with NAFLD com-pared with the concentrations in the healthy individuals as controls 97. Higher liver fat content was also associated with increased levels of triglycerides containing satu- rated or monounsaturated fatty acids and decreased concentrations of PUFA-containing phospholipids and ether lipids. In addition, they identified a lipid triplet (serum lipid signature comprising three molecular lipids) \u2014 the triglyceride 16:0/18:0/18:1, and the phos- phatidylcholines PC 18:1/22:6 and PC O-24:1/20:4 \u2014 as a biomarker of NAFLD (AUROC 0.74 and 0.71 in the discovery and validation series; AUROC 0.79, sensitivity 69.3% and specificity 74.5% in the combined biomarker discovery and validation series) 97.

Of the blood sam-ples used, 78% were citrate plasma, 16% were heparin plasma and 7% were serum samples. Nevertheless, based on systematic studies, sample type did not have a major effect on measured lipid levels 100. Gorden et al. performed lipidomics analysis on liver biopsy samples and plasma samples from 88 individuals classified based on liver histology as normal (n = 31), steatotic ( n = 17), NASH ( n = 20) or cirrhotic ( n = 20) to identify circulating lipid biomarkers that correlated with NAFLD disease progression92. In the liver, they observed significant differences in the levels of most cholesterol esters and triglycerides as well as several sphingolipids and phospholipids across disease states. In plasma, differences across histological categories were observed for major phospholipids and sphingo- lipids, including several 1-deoxy and dihydro species of sphingomyelins and ceramides. Using linear dis-criminant analysis, the researchers found 20 plasma metabolites as a metabolic signature of progression in NAFLD that could discriminate NASH and steatosis 92. Interestingly, the majority of these metabolites were sphingolipids and phospholipids and they did not detect any triglycerides or diacylglycerols associated with NAFLD progression 92. Elevation of some serum sphingolipids in patients with NASH (n = 16) compared with the levels in patients with NAFL (n = 8) was also observed in another study using lipidomics analysis101. Despite the valuable insights generated, the study was done in a very small cohort and the exclusion list for patient selection was limited.Among sphingolipids, ceramides have received considerable attention in NASH research. Ceramides are biologically active lipids involved in mitochon- drial dysfunction, cellular proliferation and oxida-tive stress, and they contribute to a pro-inflammatory environment and have been implicated in the develop- ment of NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance 102\u2013 104. Dihydroceramides, which are considered markers of de novo ceramide synthesis, are converted into cer - amides by the enzyme dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1), which inserts a conserved double bond into the backbone of dihydroceramides 105. Dihydroceramides have been linked to insulin resistance, and their hepatic concentration is increased in patients with NASH106,107. A high dihydroceramide to ceramide ratio, which indicates a reduction in DES1 activity and hepatic cer - amide levels, has also been linked to an improvement in hepatic steatosis and systemic insulin resistance in murine models 108,109. It has been reported that the liver is the major contributor to the circulating levels of these species (in addition to a substantial contribution from adipocytes)109; thus, plasma ceramide levels could potentially reflect the changes in the hepatic levels. Lipidomics has also proven to be a powerful tool for assessing heterogeneity of NAFLD and identifying the underlying mechanisms.

Luukkonen et al. compared obesity-associated NAFLD and insulin resistance (\u2018met- abolic\u2019 NAFLD) with NAFLD associated with a com- mon I148M variant in PNPLA3 at rs738409 (\u2018genetic\u2019 NAFLD) using lipidomic analysis in liver biopsy samples from 125 individuals 106. The study found that \u2018metabolic\u2019 NAFLD is specifically associated with increased concen- trations of triglycerides of low carbon number and low double bond count as well as with lipotoxic ceramides and diacylglycerols in the liver, while no such changes were observed in genetic NAFLD 106; these observations provide a potential link between obesity, NAFLD and the development of insulin resistance and T2DM. A distinct lipid signature, comprising a relative decrease in triglyc-erides, was also found in the serum of patients with a I148M variant in PNPLA3 compared with the levels in non-carriers 110. A follow-up study identified a mecha- nism by which the PNPLA3 I148M variant contributed to steatosis, namely via increased hepatic retention of PUFAs 111. In contrast to PNPLA3, lipidomic study of liver biopsy samples has shown that the E167K variant in the gene encoding transmembrane 6 superfamily mem- ber 2 (TM6SF2), which is also known to be associated with NAFLD, contributes to steatosis by increasing the synthesis of PUFAs, whereas the synthesis of complex lipids containing PUFAs is impaired 112. A deficiency in polyunsaturated phosphatidylcho- lines, the main phospholipids of the outer layer of VLDL, leads to impaired VLDL formation and export and, therefore, patients with NAFLD carrying the TM6SF2 E167K variant have lower levels of the most abundant circulating triglycerides, such as TG(16:0/18:2/18:1) and TG(16:0/18:1/18:1) 113. The variant rs641738 (C>T) of the gene encoding membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7) has also been associated with increased risk of development and progression of NAFLD in patients114. MBOAT7 is NATure revIeWS | GASTROeNTeROLOG y & HePATOLOG yReviews volume 18 | December 2021 | 845 0123456789();: a lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) transferase that prefer - entially incorporates arachidonic acid into the second acyl chain of LPIs115; therefore, a decreased arachi- donoylphosphatidylinositol to total phosphatidylinositol ratio has been found in the plasma of patients carrying the MBOAT7 variant 114. Interestingly, hepatic expression of MBOAT7 is reduced in patients with NASH and obe- sity, independently of genetic background116,117, leading to an impaired phosphatidylinositol remodelling that generates an imbalance in phosphatidylinositol-related lipid mediators117 and promotes the conversion of sat- urated LPIs to triglycerides116, 118. Fondevila et al. also found increased circulating levels of LPIs in patients with NASH compared with the levels in patients with NAFL, which was associated with a higher sever - ity of inflammation and increased hepatocellular ballooning 119. On the other hand, carriers of the pro- tective variant (rs72613567:TA) in the gene encoding hydroxysteroid 17\u03b2-dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) have increased levels of phospholipids in the liver and decreased fibrosis 120.

Similarly, carriers of the protective variant (rs2642438) in the gene encoding mitochondrial amidoxime-reducing component 1 (MARC1) have ele- vated hepatic polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines compared with non-carriers 121. Taken together, lipidomic studies in NAFLD have shown that lipid profiles are not specific to steatosis per se, but can instead distinguish subtypes of NAFLD. Bile acids. There has been growing interest in the potential role of bile acids in the development of NASH. Bile acids are synthesized in the liver from choles-terol through two pathways, either through the classic pathway via cytochrome 7\u03b1 hydroxylase (CYP7A1) enzyme or through an acidic pathway via mitochondrial cytochrome 27\u03b1 hydroxylase (CYP27A). Bile acid home-ostasis is maintained through multiple negative feed-back loops for bile acid synthesis and a tightly regulated enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Bile acids have several important functions as they not only assist lipid digestion and absorption once they are released into the intestine, but also act as signalling molecules con- trolling glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis through farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor TGR5 (reF.122). FXR also has a regula- tory role in triglyceride metabolism123\u2013 125. In the liver, FXR activation results in downregulation of CYP7A1, which in addition to inhibition of the classic bile acid synthetic pathway also reduces the expression of sev-eral genes mediating FFA synthesis, thereby attenuating DNL 126\u2013 128, as demonstrated both in rodent models and in human hepatocytes129\u2013 131. Several studies have shown increases in the levels of bile acids in liver tissue132,133, plasma132, 134, 135 and faeces134 of patients with NASH. A positive association between circulating bile acids (taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid and glycocholic acid) and HOMA-IR has also been observed in individuals with obesity136. Most studies have shown dysregulation of bile acid metabolism in patients with NASH, including elevated levels of primary conjugated bile acids, decreased levels of specific secondary bile acids and alteration of excreted bile acids 129,132,133,135 (Fig. 3). Mechanistically, it has been indicated that CYP7A1 expression is dysregulated in patients with NAFLD, with most studies reporting upregulated expression129, 135, 137\u2013 139, although there are also studies showing no association between CYP7A1 expression and NASH140. Overall, there is agreement across the results that bile acids are elevated in the cir - culation and in the liver of patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH. Alterations have also been observed in expression of bile acid transporters in humans, such as the canalicular bile acid transporter (bile salt excretory pump (BSEP)) and the sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypep- tide (NTCP). Although the studies have been some-what inconsistent, BSEP expression has been shown to be decreased in patients with steatosis or NASH com - pared with expression in healthy individuals 135, 138, 141, thus indicating decreased bile secretion. On the other hand, NTCP mRNA"

On the other hand, NTCP mRNA expression levels have been shown to be statistically significantly upregulated in patients with NAFLD compared with the levels in healthy individuals 129,135,139, thus suggesting increased uptake of bile acids by the liver. It should be noted that alteration of BSEP expression might be partially influenced by the BMI of individuals. Currently, only a few studies have assessed hepatic bile acids in patients with NASH. In one study, bile acid composition was determined by gas chromatography in liver tissue from patients with NASH (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n = 8). Total bile acid concentra- tions were significantly higher in patients with NASH (107.6 \u00b1 18.2 nmol/g, wet weight) than in the control group (67.1 \u00b1 6.5 nmol/g; P < 0.05)133. Individual bile acids including cholic, chenodeoxycholic and deoxy-cholic acids were also significantly increased in patients with NASH compared with the control group (by 43%, 64% and 92%, respectively) 133. In addition, there was a significant association between cholic acid and his- tological markers of liver injury such as inflammation in patients with NASH ( r = 0.54, P < 0.05). Conversely, deoxycholic acid levels were negatively associated with inflammation in patients with NASH (r = \u20130.65, P < 0.01). Chenodeoxycholic acid was also signifi- cantly associated with both portal and lobular fibro-sis in patients with NASH (r = 0.49, P < 0.05) 133. Lake et al. evaluated liver biopsy samples from seven healthy individuals, four patients with steatosis, 14 patients with NASH with fatty liver (>5% fat deposition) and 23 patients with NASH without fatty liver (<5% fat deposition) and found that in patients with NASH, taurine-conjugated bile acids were increased, whereas cholic acid and glycodeoxycholic acid were decreased, suggesting a potential shift during NASH towards the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis, which is mediated by increased mRNA and protein expression of CYP7B1 (reF.140). In another study in 20 individu- als without diabetes and 22 patients with diabetes, of whom 77.7% had NAFLD with a NAFLD activity score (NAS) of \u22652, total hepatic bile acids were significantly downregulated (P = 0.0017) in the group with diabetes compared with the control group 142. The significant decrease was mainly due to the conjugated bile acids. In a Chinese cohort (n = 134 individuals), analysis of www.nature.com/nrgastroReviews 846 | December 2021 | volume 18 0123456789();: hepatic and circulating bile acids revealed increased levels of circulating and hepatic conjugated cheno- deoxycholic acid in patients with NASH as well as an elevated ratio of conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid to muricholic acid in patients with NAFLD compared with the levels in healthy individuals 143.

In another study, bile acids were measured in 39 patients with NAFL, 59 patients with NASH and ten healthy individ- uals, and an increase in serum levels of bile acids and in bile acid transport in NASH were found 139. Adiponectin was also found to be inversely correlated with serum bile acids and hepatocellular death, related to a potential effect of adiponectin on bile acid homeostasis\u2010related genes, especially CYP7A1 (reF.139).

Bile acids marked with red boxes indicate upregulation and blue boxes indicate downregulation. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol via two pathways. The major, classic pathway is initiated and rate-limited by cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1) to synthesize CA and CDCA. The alternative pathway is initiated and catalysed by CYP27A1 to synthesize CDCA. CDCA can be further converted into HCA and MCA in the liver. Then, the bile acids are conjugated to the amino acids taurine or glycine before being released into the intestine, with hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1 ) having a central role in bile acid conjugation by direct regulation of very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (VLACSR) and BAAT. In the distal ileum and colon, the bile acids undergo a variety of bacterial transformations including deconjugation, dehydroxylation and epimerization by the gut microbiota to produce a variety of secondary bile acids. Bile acids are recovered into portal blood through a combination of passive absorption in the proximal small intestine, active transport via apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT) in the distal ileum, and passive absorption in the colon and via organic solute transporter \u03b1 /\u03b2 (OST\u03b1 /\u03b2). The majority (90\u201395%) of bile acids secreted into the small intestine are actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and circulate back to the liver while about 5% are excreted via faeces.

In a cohort of 86 individuals (24 controls, 25 with NAFL and 37 with NASH), the total levels of plasma primary bile acids increased in a stepwise manner from the con- trols to patients with NAFL and to those with NASH, and the changes in the bile acid profile were most severe in those with NASH and were independent of the pres- ence of diabetes in patients with NAFL 135. Legry et al. studied bile acid metabolism in a cohort of drug-naive patients with obesity with NASH (n = 32) and controls (no NASH) matched for BMI and insulin resistance (n = 26) 138. The alterations in bile acid metabolism were associated with insulin resistance, rather than with liver necroinflammation itself. These findings highlight the complex interactions between insulin resistance and bile acid metabolism in NAFLD and NASH. Other studies have found elevated levels of specific bile acids in patients with NAFLD and NASH 129,146. Ferslew et al. quantified bile acids in 15 healthy individuals and 7 patients with NASH during fast- ing as well as following a high-fat meal (at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min) using MS-based metabolomics 147. They observed an increase in the fasting levels of both pri- mary and secondary bile acids in patients with NASH. Total fasting serum bile acid concentrations (total con-centrations of unconjugated bile acids, and bile acids conjugated with glycine, taurine and sulfate) in patients with NASH were increased 2.2-fold to 2.4-fold com- pared with the concentrations in healthy individuals, which was due predominantly to higher concentra-tions of taurine-conjugated and glycine-conjugated bile acids.

Taurine-conjugated bile acids increased 5.6-fold, whereas glycine-conjugated bile acids increased only by 3.2-fold 147. Increases in serum bile acids were also observed in both healthy individuals and patients with NASH following a challenge with a standardized high-fat breakfast, although patients with NASH demonstrated a greater postprandial increase in all bile acid groups except lithocholic acid and 6\u03b1-hydroxylated bile acids. In addition, postprandial levels of chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid were significantly increased in patients with NASH com-pared with the levels in healthy individuals (P < 0.05). The researchers concluded that the observed distinct shift in levels of fasting and postprandial circulating bile acids, especially hydrophobic bile acids, might influence NAFLD progression and could have implications in the diagnosis and staging of NASH 147. In summary, most studies have found increased lev- els of circulatory total bile acids in patients with NASH and steatosis, mainly due to upregulation of conjugated bile acids. Conflicting results have been reported on the levels of secondary bile acids in NAFLD. Several studies have indicated that it is the ratios between spe- cific bile acids, that is, the composition of the bile acid pool, that have a crucial role in NAFLD\u2013NASH rather than the concentrations of total or individual bile acids. The results also indicate that insulin resistance is a contributing factor in the dysregulation of circulating bile acids. In liver, only a limited number of studies have been performed, with contradictory results. Thus, there is currently no clear consensus for the hepatic bile acid profile in patients with NAFLD. Gut microbial metabolites in NAFLD\u2013NASH. The gut microbiota interacts with the liver via the so-called gut\u2013liver axis, which describes the bidirectional rela-tionship between the gut, its microbiota, and the liver. Dysfunction of the gut\u2013liver axis can markedly contrib- ute to the development and progression of NAFLD 148. Metabolites derived from the intestinal microbiota, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids and AAAs and their derivatives, have emerged as important factors modulating the pathological process of NAFLD, as previ-ously discussed 148. The gut microbiota can also modulate the endocannabinoid system as well as choline metab- olism, which is needed for the synthesis of VLDL parti- cles and transport of lipids out of the liver. In addition, lipopolysaccharides are associated with the gut\u2013liver axis as they activate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in liver macrophages, causing inflammation of hepatocytes 149,150. Overall, the mechanisms underlying the hepatic responses to the bioactive substances derived from gut bacteria have been associated with the regula- tion of lipid metabolism, immune signalling response and redox homeostasis 151. Specifically, NAFLD has been associated with intesti - nal bacterial overgrowth and increased intestinal perme-ability, faecal secondary bile acids, and intestinal SCFAs, BCAAs and AAAs, such as tryptophan 152\u2013 156. Patients with NAFLD have also been shown to have higher levels of both SCFA-producing bacteria and SCFAs156,157. SCFAs have multiple roles. They are involved in the regulation of inflammation,"

Patients with NAFLD have also been shown to have higher levels of both SCFA-producing bacteria and SCFAs156,157. SCFAs have multiple roles. They are involved in the regulation of inflammation, cell proliferation and mucus secretion. In hepatocytes, they are substrates for gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis, and they promote the accumulation of hepatic FFAs by inhibiting the activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase 157. As discussed earlier, the gut microbiota modulates the bile acid pool, and the composition of the gut microbi- ome determines the deconjugation, dehydroxylation and oxidation of secondary bile acids 158. Moreover, bile acids can modulate the gut microbial composition owing to their antimicrobial properties, either directly or by indi - rect effects through FXR-induced antimicrobial peptides as shown in murine models and in ileal explants159\u2013 161. Moreover, they can also modify the gut barrier func- tion, for example by regulating tight junctions and their actions162. Bile acids influence FXR-mediated signal- ling in the intestine and the liver and, therefore, have a substantial effect on overall metabolism. Changes in intestinal microbiota composition can also lead to alterations in bioavailability of choline and increased portal influx of trimethylamine, both of which have been associated with hepatic steatosis and dam- age in mice141. Choline deficiency is associated with a decreased methylation capacity, perturbed phosphati- dylcholine synthesis, and impaired VLDL assembly and secretion, which can then initiate the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver 163,164. www.nature.com/nrgastroReviews 848 | December 2021 | volume 18 0123456789();: Other microbial metabolites that have been identified as potential inducers of steatosis and hepatic inflammation in humans include AAAs such as phenylacetic acid, imi- dazole propionate and 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate165,166. Other derivatives of the amino acid tryptophan, such as indolic compounds (indole and indole-3-acetate), have been indicated to have a protective role by preserving liver integrity in mice 167. Fluxomics in NAFLD\u2013NASH While metabolomics and lipidomics describe a static sit - uation, the measurement of metabolic fluxes, so-called fluxomics, enables a dynamic picture of the situation providing a better understanding of phenotype. In met-abolic diseases, such as NAFLD, the metabolic remod-elling is due to changes in metabolic fluxes 168. Fluxomic analysis requires the use of stable isotope MS meas - urement of tracer enrichments and labelled metabolic products, and mathematical models of tracer kinetics in plasma samples (Fig. 4). Human metabolic flux analysis using stable isotope tracers labelled with 13C and/or 2H have been used since the 1970s to study glucose metabolism (that is, to measure endogenous glucose production, glucose dis- posal, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, and hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance) as well as lipid metabolism (that is, lipolysis, DNL, VLDL secretion and clearance, and triglyceride synthesis). 15N isotopes have been used to study amino acid metabolism (that is, protein synthesis and catabolism, and urea turnover) 169.Using fluxomic analysis, it has been demon - strated that patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD have increased insulin resistance at the level of the liver,"

Moreover, metabolic diseases such as NAFLD and T2DM are also associated with increased DNL66,69,171 and glyceroneogenesis172, 173, whereas whether VLDL secretion is impaired or reduced is still under debate66,174. Lately, fluxomic analysis has also been used in animal and cell studies, enabling a more comprehensive under - standing of intracellular fluxes, including alterations in mitochondrial activity and the TCA cycle116,175,176. Conclusions and future directions This Review evaluate the contribution of metabolom-ics and lipidomics in clinical studies aimed at identi- fying biomarkers associated with the pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH. Considering the prevalence of NAFLD, the importance of monitoring metabolism during the early stages of disease pathogenesis, and the lack of robustly validated diagnostic and prog- nostic biomarkers for NAFLD, there is an urgent need for advances towards the qualification of biomarkers for NAFLD in clinical practice. Although metabolomics and lipidomics approaches have provided insightful evidence into altered metabolic pathways in NAFLD and NASH, we note that very few reported biomark-ers have been validated and used in clinical practice (TaBle 2 ).

Insulin resistance is associated with the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In an insulin-resistant state, insulin fails to stimulate glucose metabolism in several organs, including muscle, liver and adipose tissue. This results in increased endogenous glucose production (EGP) and insufficient glucose disposal. Insulin resistance in adipose tissue results in increased lipolysis and circulating fatty acids, which in turn can contribute to the worsening of insulin resistance and ectopic fat accumulation. In addition, insulin resistance results in excess muscle catabolism and increased circulating amino acids. Using fluxomics and stable isotope ( 13C, 2H and 15N) tracers, it is possible to measure metabolic fluxes in vivo in humans, including EGP , lipolysis, VLDL secretion and protein catabolism. Potential biomarkers of NAFLD include triglycerides and free fatty acids (FFAs) (due to adipose tissue lipolysis), amino acids (AAs) (released during fasting mainly by muscle protein catabolism), and hepatic lipids, such as triglycerides, ceramides and phosphatidylcholines.

Impairment in amino acid metabolism in NAFLD is linked to insulin resistance and results in higher fasting concentrations of essential amino acids, as has also been observed in obesity. In patients with chronic liver disease, AAAs, in particular phenylalanine and its metabolite tyrosine, are frequently found to be decreased whereas BCAAs, especially leucine, isoleucine, valine and glutamate\u2013glutamine are increased, mainly because of insulin resistance. However, as liver disease pro - gresses, the opposite is often observed, with high AAAs and reduced BCAAs, especially in patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency. In addition, a reduction in hepatic glutathione levels and elevation of methionine levels has been associated with liver damage and the progression of NAFLD to NASH. However, there is some inconsist- ency in the identified patterns and levels of reported amino acids in patients with NAFLD\u2013NASH. This inconsistency is, in part, due to application of differ - ent metabolomics approaches, but also to the charac- terization of the clinical cohort (for example, different stage of NAFLD or different insulin resistance state). Our assessment further emphasizes the importance of implementing validated methods as well as identifying large well-characterized clinical cohorts. Another important observation is related to altera- tions in lipid metabolism. NASH is strongly associated with alterations in circulating fatty acid flux and intact lipids such as triglycerides and phospholipids, which is partially due to alterations in liver DNL, lipolysis rate and VLDL metabolism.

Interestingly, this pattern of changes in triglycerides has also been reported in metabolic disorders, especially those associated with insulin resistance. Moreover, sev- eral studies have shown an increase in total bile acids in both liver and plasma of patients with NASH. In particu-lar, a statistically significant increase in fasting plasma concentration of bile acids including glycocholic, tauro- cholic and taurochenodeoxycholic acid in patients with NASH has been observed.

Although there are several reports on potential biomarkers, very few have been val- idated and used in the clinic, which is not unexpected, as different methods were applied in different populations. From an analytical perspective, the method of metab- olite or lipid identification and quantification in particu- lar might have a major effect on biomarker selection. In addition, some of the findings are based on relative differences in molecular biomarker concentrations, and it is not known whether this would be sufficient for diagnosis or prognosis of NASH. For diagnostic applications, as well as for the repro - ducibility of biomarker studies in general, it would be important to accurately quantify the metabolites, that is, by using appropriate internal standards, calibration and quality control, and using standard reference materials such as NIST-SRM 1950 (reF.177). Although quantifica- tion might not be practically possible in comprehensive screening studies covering hundreds or even thousands of metabolites, steps can already be taken to improve the accuracy of quantification, as, for example, recom - mended in the lipidomics community 177. Subsequent validation studies would need to further focus on metab- olite quantification, as this is the best way to assure the reliability of diagnostic signatures. Across different ana - lytical methods, relative concentrations of different metabolites measured might change if not accurately quantified. Additionally, for each biomarker, it would be essential to assess analytical variation with respect to normal, within-person variation. Moreover, the role of biomarker trajectories in individual patients was not assessed in most of the studies, which could be essential for understanding the long-term outcome of patients. In order to derive robust metabolic signatures of NAFLD\u2013NASH, the reported biomarkers will need to be consolidated and validated. From an analytical perspective, this can be achieved, for example by har - monization of analytical approaches, including the use of similar methods of quantitation. While the discov- ery of metabolomics platforms with comprehensive metabolite coverage is important for the identification of putative disease biomarkers, further developments and validation of these biomarkers will require methods that can achieve accurate quantification of selected metabo- lites, thus assuring better interlaboratory and interstudy reproducibility. Current efforts to improve metabolomics and lipidomics workflows 177,178 are expected to improve our ability to effectively bridge the biomarker discovery stage, validation studies and translation to the clinic. Another area that is likely to lead to substantial advances in NASH biomarkers is investigation of mul- tiomics biomarkers179\u2013 182. The gut microbiome is also a rich source of circulating metabolite biomarkers, as discussed in this Review and elsewhere148, 151, 152, 167. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions are now available for large numbers of gut microbial species 183. Application of genome-scale metabolic modelling on shotgun metagenomics data from stool samples can predict which metabolites are being produced in spe-cific diseases or physiological conditions 184.

Adding different layers of omics data is thus likely to lead to both improved sensitivity as well as specificity of NAFLD\u2013NASH biomarkers. However, clinical vali-dation and translation of multimodal diagnostic tools might prove more challenging than only a single layer, both technologically as well as from the health econom-ics perspective. Nevertheless, adding multiple layers of data will enrich our knowledge about the complex pathophysiology of NAFLD\u2013NASH and is expected to facilitate our search for biomarker candidates with the greatest sensitivity and specificity.
