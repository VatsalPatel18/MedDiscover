Whereas the diagnosis and treatment of manifest diabetes have been well investigated , the identification of novel pathways or early biomarkers indicative of metabolic alterations or insulin resistance related to the development of diabetes is still in progress. Over half of the type 2 diabetes patients show manifestations of diabetes9related diseases, whi ch highlights the need for early screening markers of diabetes. During the last decade, the rapidly growing research field of metabolomics has introduced new insights into the pa thology of diabetes as well as methods to predict disease onset and revealed new biomarker. A recent epidemiological studies firstly used metabolism to predict incident diabetes and revealed branched9chain and aromatic amino acids including isoleucine, leucine, vali ne, tyrosine and phenylalanine as highly9significant predictors of future diabetes. This review summarizes the current findings of metabolic research in animal models and human investigat ions. Page 2 of 33 3INTRODUCTION Diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2DM), represents one of t he most significant global health problems because it is associated with a large economic burden for the health systems of many countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) repo rted that worldwide 171 million subjects are affect by diabetes in 2000, which is equival ent to a prevalence of 2.8%, and these reports predicted an estimated future number of 366 mill ion affected individuals in 2030, which would be equivalent to a diabetes prevalence of 4.4% (Wild, et al. 2004). However, recent data of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) revealed t hat this number has already been achieved in 2011. The IDF expected an even higher number of 552 million affected persons in 2030. Due to the broad range of diabetes9related complications, including diabetic nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy and cardiovascular disease, diabetes is a major cause of both morbidity and mortality. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that is characterised by high blood gl ucose levels, which may be due either to the progressive failure of pancreatic beta9cell function and consequently a lack of insulin production (type 1: T1DM) or to the development of insulin resistance and subsequently the loss in beta9cell function (T2DM). Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2DM. T1DM is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component."

        "text": "the progressive failure of pancreatic beta9cell function and consequently a lack of insulin production (type 1: T1DM) or to the development of insulin resistance and subsequently the loss in beta9cell function (T2DM). Approximately 90% of patients with diabetes have T2DM. T1DM is an autoimmune disease with a strong genetic component. Genetic susceptibility to T1DM has been intensively investigated, and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) was reported to be the main genetic determinant (Noble and Erlich 2012; Polychronakos and Li 2011). The predominant cause of T2DM is related to lifestyle factors including diet, insufficient physical activit y, an overweight or obese state and stress. Furthermore, at least 36 genes, accounting for 10% of the total genetic component, have been significantly associated with an increased risk for T2DM (Herder and Roden 2011). Moreover, further 18 genes were related to glucose and HbA1c levels as well as insulin resistance. Detailed reviews on the genetics of T1DM and T2DM have been presented elsewhere (Herder and Roden 2011; Polychronakos and Li 2011). The diagnosis of diabetes is mainly based on the results of blood tests examini ng fasting plasma glucose or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels ( World Health Organization 2006). Page 3 of 33 4Additionally, the treatment of diabetes is linked to these measures, as the main goal of antidiabetic therapy is to reduce blood glucose and HbA1c levels via the administra tion of insulin (T1DM) or antidiabetic medication (T2DM). Furthermore, lifestyl e changes, such as eating a more healthful diet, performing regular physical activity, achiev ing a normal body weight and smoking cessation, are recommended for diabetic patients. Whereas the diagnosis and treatment of manifest diabetes have been thoroughly investigated, the identification of novel pathways or early biomarkers indi cative of metabolic alterations or insulin resistance related to the development of T2DM is still underway. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showed that estimated 57.9 % of subjects with diagnosed diabetes are affected by one or m ore macro9 or microvascular complications (American Association of Clinical Endoc rinologists 2007), which highlights the need for early screening markers to monitor the development o f T2DM. During the last decade, the rapidly growing research field of metabolomics has intr oduced new insights into the pathology of diabetes as well as methods to predict disease onset. In accordance with the other \u201comics\u201d techniques, such as genomics, transc riptomics or proteomics, the term metabonomics, which is synonymous with metabolomic s or metabolic profiling, was first introduced by Nicholson and colleagues in 1999 (Nichol son, et al. 1999). Metabolomics relates to measurements of the metabolome, which represents t he entire collection of all small9molecule metabolites present in any biological orga nism (Oliver, et al. 1998; Tweeddale, et al. 1998). The advantages of metabolomics over other \u201com ics\u201d technologies include its high level of sensitivity and its ability to enable t he analysis of relatively few metabolites compared with the unwieldy number of corres ponding genes or mRNA molecules.

The advantages of metabolomics over other \u201com ics\u201d technologies include its high level of sensitivity and its ability to enable t he analysis of relatively few metabolites compared with the unwieldy number of corres ponding genes or mRNA molecules. The comprehensive Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) contai ned approximately 7900 metabolite entries in January 2009. Another advantage of metab olomics is that metabolites are the final downstream products of the interaction between genes and influences like environmental factors, health behaviour or pharmaceutical interventions, and metabolite levels reflect the activity of metabolic pathways. Theref ore, metabolomics enables Page 4 of 33 5the detection of short9term as well long9term physiological or pathologic al changes in cells, tissues or body fluids and represents a useful tool for biomarker detect ion. The purpose of the present review is to summarise current metabolomics t echnologies and to provide an overview of the contribution of metabolomics to diabetes resear ch. METABOLOMICS TECHNOLOGIES The two main high9throughput metabolomics tools consist of nuclear magnetic r esonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Both methods enable t he comprehensive investigation of metabolic profiles (Dunn, et al. 2005; Hollywood, et al. 2006 ; Lenz and Wilson 2007) and can provide complementary snapshots of the metabolome of bod y fluids such as plasma, urine or cerebrospinal fluid (Bictash, et al. 2010). Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy NMR is a widely used spectroscopic technique for metabolomics that is bas ed on the magnetic properties of the atomic nucleus (e.g., 1H, 13C, or 31P). This method was first used for the analysis of body fluids in the 1980s (Bell, et al. 1989; Iles, et al. 1985; Nicholson, et al. 1984). The behaviour of NMR active nuclei in a strong magnetic field provides i nformation about the structural and chemical properties of a molecule. Due to the hi gh abundance of the 1H nucleus, 1H9NMR spectroscopy has been heavily utilised to investigate biological f luids such as plasma and urine as well as tissues. Each separate signal in a 1H9NMR spectrum corresponds to a particular compound. Exemplary 1H9NMR spectra for human urine and plasma are shown in figure 1. Based on measurements of 9 chemical shift 9 spin\u2013spin coupling: Neighbouring nuclei influence the effective magnetic field which results in spin interaction. The so called spin-spin coupling can cause splitting of the signal into two or more peaks. 9 relaxation: Describes the return to equilibrium of net magnetization and included two types of relaxation: Spin-Lattice (T 1, also called longitudinal relaxation) and Spin-Page 5 of 33 6 Spin (T 2, also called transverse relaxation) . 9 diffusion the identification of single metabolites and absolute quantification are poss ible. Detailed information regarding NMR theory, its application and typical chemical s hift values is available elsewhere (Bl\u00fcmich 2005). The application of NMR spectroscopy in metabolomics ranges from pharmaceutical studies (Lindon, et al. 2007) to cardiovascular bi omarker identification (Griffin, et al. 2011; Rhee and Gerszten 2012).

The application of NMR spectroscopy in metabolomics ranges from pharmaceutical studies (Lindon, et al. 2007) to cardiovascular bi omarker identification (Griffin, et al. 2011; Rhee and Gerszten 2012). Advantages of NMR spectroscopy include the non9destructive nature of the analys is, the robust and reproducible measurements and the minimal preparation requirements, as no separation or ionisation steps are necessary. However, in comparison to MS, the analytical sensitivity of NMR is relatively low, even if stronger magnetic fi elds are used to increase the analytical sensitivity. Mass spectrometry MS is a powerful tool for investigating molecular structure as well as f or detecting and quantifying metabolites (Lenz and Wilson 2007). The first step in MS c onsists of the ionisation of the analyte, which is followed by the separation of the ions ac cording to their mass9to9charge (m/z) ratio using an analyser with an electromagnetic fiel d. In metabolomics, MS is often combined with other suitable methods for the analytical separ ation of compounds, including gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC), to achieve detection of distinct metabolite classes (Buscher, et al. 2009). One study comparing GC, LC and capillary electrophoresis (CE) revealed that LC was the most robust method and enabled the br oadest coverage of metabolite classes (Buscher et al. 2009). However, both GC9MS und LC9MS demonstrate high separation efficiency and are excellent tools for metaboli c profiling. Exemplary MS spectrum for human urine is shown in figure 2. The application of MS in the metabolomics field ranges from studies of microorganisms and plants to biomarker detection. The greatest advantage of the MS methods is their high level of sensitivity , although disadvantages arise from the destruction of the sample and the long sample preparat ion time Page 6 of 33 7required. Detailed descriptions of MS methods have been provided elsewhere (de Hoffmann and Stroobant 2007). Due to the limited overlap for metabolite detection and thus the compleme ntary nature of MS and NMR spectroscopy, studies using a multiplatform approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding of metabolic alterations than studies using only one of these tools (Williams, et al. 2006a). EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES APPLIED TO GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND DIABETES Dietary-induced obesity and insulin resistance A series of experimental studies have been conducted using dietary9induced obesity or insulin resistance rodent models to investigate the metabolic profiles of urine (Kim, et al. 2009), blood (Li, et al. 2010a; Shearer, et al. 2008) or tissue (Li et al. 2010a; Lin, et al. 2011), and these results have led to new insights into the development of diabetes. Dietary9induced obesity models have the advantage of being more similar to the development of human obesity in comparison to genetic models , and as a result, these models mirror the progression of insulin resistance and diabetes after a prolonged period of developmen t (Fearnside, et al. 2008).

High9fat9fed C57BL/6J mice become obese and insuli n resistant and demonstrate different serum levels of 1H9NMR9based metabolite concentrations in comparison to chow9fed mice (Shearer et al. 2008). Whereas the citrate concentration was higher in high9fat9fed mice than in chow9fed mice, the concentrations of glycine, lysine, suberate, acetate, leucine, valine or trimethylamine N9oxide were signif icantly lower in high9 fat9fed mice. Furthermore, dietary9induced insulin resistance could be predicted according to various metabolite levels, specifically those of lysine, glycine, cit rate, leucine, suberate and acetate, and these metabolite levels could also be used to discriminate between c how9 and high9fat9fed animals. Additionally, the urinary metabolic profiles of hi gh9fat9fed rats were significantly different from those of normal9diet9fed rats (Kim et al. 2009). 1H9NMR spectroscopy also revealed diet9related variations in the levels of betaine, taur ine, acetone/acetoacetate, phenylacetylglycine, pyruvate, lactate and citrate. MS9based studies Page 7 of 33 8can also detect additional diet9induced changes in metabolites (Li et al. 2010a; Lin et al. 2011); one study investigated the diet9induced inhibition of insulin in the l iver tissue and plasma of wild9type and glycerol939phosphate acyltransferase 1 (GPAT91)9de ficient mice, which remain insulin sensitive independent of their diet (Li et al. 2010a). As suming that metabolic changes identified in insulin9resistant wild9type mice are speci fically related to hepatic insulin resistance and may therefore indicate a causative pathwa y, these authors demonstrated alterations in the concentrations of 43 liver and 19 plasma metabol ites. The identified increases in urea cycle9related metabolites, such as citrull ine, aspartate or N9 acetyl9glutamate, were indicative of early up9regulation of the urea cyc le, whereas the altered levels of liver metabolites suggested the existence of variations in gluc ose metabolism (1,59 anhydroglucitol decrease), bile acid metabolism (taurocholate decrease) and pyrimidine metabolism (2\u20329deoxyuridine increase). Moreover, the increase in pyrimidi ne metabolites and the decreases in bradykinin, kynurenine and \u03b19ketoglutarate concentrations were al so confirmed in the plasma. A separate MS study extended this approach of diet 9induced insulin resistance to include a metabolic oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and addit ionally examined liver, brain and skeletal tissues (Lin et al. 2011). These MS data enabled the authors to discriminate between both the 1209min and 09min time points for both standard9 fed (SD) and high9fructose9fed (HFrD) rats, and these data also identif ied specific metabolic effects in insulin9resistant rats. As expected, insulin adminis tration9related up9regulation of lysophosphatidylcholines (Lin et al. 2011) was observed in SD rats but not in HFrD rats. However, the levels of the branched9chain amino acids (BCAA) proline, tryptophan and methionine were decreased in HFrD rats at 120 min but were unchanged in SD rats , and opposite effects were observed for the amino acids leucine and isoleuc ine, which had previously been shown to be related to insulin sensitivity (Shaham, et al. 2008) and were present"

By comparing SD and HFrD rats at the 09min time point, differences were identified for various compounds, including phospholipids, ami no acids, bile acids, fatty acids and metabolites. Moreover, regarding purine metabolism and t he Krebs cycle, a complex metabolic perturbation in HFrD rats was observed. I ncreased levels of Page 8 of 33 9phospholipids and fatty acid were also found in high9fat9fed mice in combination wi th lower levels of betaine, carnitine and acylcarnitines, which are metabolites involved in lipid metabolism (Kim, et al. 2011). In liver and skeletal muscle tissue, a high9fructose diet leads to oxidative stress, elevated levels of amino acids and alterations in fatty acid biosynthesis, whereas this type of diet is related to decreased amino acid levels and the up9regulation of purine biosynthesis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Lin et al. 2011). In general, the distinction between diet9related effects and obesity9related ef fects represents a common problem in dietary9induced diabetes models. One recent study in mice investigated the long9 and short9term consequences of various types of di ets and aimed to distinguish the specific effects of each diet from those of obesity in gener al (Duggan, et al. 2011). The results revealed that diet has a major impact on the metabolic pr ofiles measured by 1H9NMR; whereas diet influenced metabolites related to energy and glucose metabolism, obesity mainly caused alterations in amino acids and large non9polar molecules . Genetic rodent models of diabetes Genetic T2DM models have several advantages over diet9induced models, including a s hort generation time, heritable traits and lower cost, although the \u201cnatural\u201d devel opment of diabetes over a prolonged period of time is lacking in these animals. The t wo most popular obesity/T2DM models include the db/db model and the obese Zucker (fa/fa) model, w hich are both characterised by an autosomal recessive defect in the leptin receptor gene that results in obesity and subsequent insulin resistance (Chen and Wang 2005). Based on these models, differences in urinary (Connor, et al. 2010; Gipson, et al. 2008; Patterson, et al. 2011; Salek, et al. 2007; Williams, et al. 2005a; Williams, et al. 2006b; Zhao, et al. 2010a), plasma (Major, et al. 2006; Williams et al. 2006a) and tissue (Connor et al. 2010; Xu, et al. 2009) metabolic profiles have been reported between affected and control rodents. Sever al studies have demonstrated profound alterations in metabolites involved in the tric arboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

The TCA cycle is an amphibolic pathway that occurs in the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays an important role in energy metabolism. The final Page 9 of 33 10products of fatty acid degradation and glycolysis are included in the TCA cycl e, and TCA cycle intermediates are involved in amino acid synthesis and degradation as well as gluconeogenesis. Whereas Zucker rats (Williams et al. 2005a; Williams et al. 2006b; Zhao et al. 2010a) typically have decreased urinary concentrations of TCA metabolites, suc h as citrate, malate, fumarate, 29ketoglutarate or succinate, the db/db mous e (Connor et al. 2010; Salek et al. 2007) has exhibited increased levels of TCA metabolites, and these change s are indicative of the down9 and up9regulation of the TCA cycle, respective ly. In a study with rhesus macaques, animals with T2DM demonstrated 29fold higher levels of citrat e compared to normal animals (Patterson et al. 2011). Additionally, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats with T1DM induced by streptozotocin demonstrated higher levels of pyruvate, succinate and f umarate (Zhang, et al. 2008). This study further showed strong associations between TCA c ycle intermediates and components of glucose metabolism in normal rats, specific ally between pyruvate, as the end product of glycolysis, and 29oxoglutarate, fumarat e or citrate. In diabetic rats, there was evidence for a disturbed balance between the TCA cycle and glucose metabolism, as the glucose levels were not associated with those of lact ate or various TCA cycle intermediates. Thus, the concentrations of succinate were not correl ated with those of 29oxoglutarate or citrate (Zhang et al. 2008). Beside disturbances in interm ediate correlations, the metabolite composition demonstrated a strong age9dependent variation. Wil liams and colleagues (Williams et al. 2006b) reported that the urinary ratios of \u03b19ketoglutarate and succinate to citrate were in favour of citrate at an age of four we eks in Zucker rats, although this finding was no longer apparent at 20 weeks. In db/db mice, a decrease i n the concentration of both TCA and non9TCA metabolites was also reported with age (Salek et al. 2007). Regarding taurine, the urinary levels in control and Zucker rats w ere comparable at eight weeks, whereas taurine was absent in 50% of the Zucker animals at 20 weeks (Williams et al. 2006b). Other metabolites involved in amino acid me tabolism have been shown to be associated with T2DM. For example, amino acids, such as p henylalanine, valine, tryptophan, lysine and glutamic acid, and amino acid metabolites, such as 29 hydroxyisobutyrate, 29hydroxyisovalerate and kynurenic acid, were present at highe r Page 10 of 33 11concentrations in the urine of Zucker rats (Connor et al. 2010; Gipson et al. 2008; Salek et al. 2007), db/db mice (Connor et al. 2010; Gipson et al. 2008) and monkeys (Patt erson et al. 2011) than in control animals, although lower concentrations of these compounds have also been reported (Salek et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2006b).

These results p rovide evidence for the complex perturbation of amino acid metabolism in diabetic disease. The largest portion of amino acid metabolism takes place in the liver, and although a broad ran ge of amino acids are glucogenic and are utilised for hepatic gluconeogenesis, a smaller number of a mino acids are ketogenic and are converted to ketone bodies. An additional rodent study (Moc hida, et al. 2011) on T1DM using the AKITA mouse model confirmed these previous urine findings and demonstrated higher amino acid, BCAA, alanine, citrulline and proline levels i n the plasma of T1DM rats indicative of disease state9dependent changes. As hyp erglycaemia progressed, the differences regarding the mentioned amino acids and BCAA became more pronounced. Additionally, these authors demonstrated a relation between increased blood glucose levels and increases in plasma levels of valine, leucine, isoleuci ne, BCAA and alanine (Mochida et al. 2011). In addition to insulin resistance, BCAA supplem entation to the high9fat diet leads to chronic increased activation of mTOR in rats (Newgard, et al. 2009), and overactivation of the mTOR/S6K1 pathway has been linked to the development of insulin resistance via beta9cell adaptation to hyperglycaemia (Fraenkel, et al. 2008; Khamzina, et al. 2005; Um, et al. 2004). Further details concerning the relation between a mino acids and diabetes are provided in the human studies section of this review. A series of rodent studies found increased urinary levels of fatty acids in Zucker rats (Salek et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2006b). Furthermore, higher levels of carnit ine, an essential compound for the transport of fatty acids from the cytosol into the mitochondria, and one that is related to T2DM (De Palo, et al. 1981), have been observed in diabetic r odents (Connor et al. 2010; Williams et al. 2006b). A multiplatform study confirmed the enriched fatty acid metabolism of the db/db mouse by revealing increased transcript levels of f atty acid metabolism9associated carnitine palmitoyltransferase (Cpt) in the liver and higher urinary carnitine levels, as measured using LC9MS (Gipson et al. 2008). Furthermore, increased Page 11 of 33 12carnitine levels with age were observed in db/db but not in control mice, and similar age9 dependent increases in carnitine were also reported in non9diabetic rats (Will iams, et al. 2005b). Increased fatty acid metabolism result from a higher rate of lipol ysis in adipose tissue and might exacerbate insulin resistance in liver and muscle tis sue (Delarue and Magnan 2007). High fatty acid levels subsequently lead to a higher oxidation rat e and therefore to the induction of ketogenesis. Thus, diabetic animals typicall y exhibit higher levels of ketone bodies, including \u03b29hydroxybutyrate or acetone, as compared to controls (Salek et al. 2007; Zhao et al. 2010a). Similar to changes in amino acid levels,"

Similar to changes in amino acid levels, increased levels of ketone bodies have been associated with the diseased state as well as age (Sal ek et al. 2007). Taken together, the shift from euglycaemia towards hyperglycaemia is likely linked to pronounced metabolic perturbations and mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction. Beside the previously mentioned metabolites, a wide range of additional urine or tissue metabol ites, e.g., choline, allantoin, glycine or betaine, has also been related to obesity or diabetes in different studies (Gipson et al. 2008; Patterson et al. 2011; Salek et al. 2007; Wil liams et al. 2005a; Williams et al. 2006b; Zhang et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2010a). Several studies have also detected differences in metabolites known to ori ginate from the gut microflora. For example, hippurate, which is mainly produced via gut microbial metabolism (Nicholson, et al. 2005), was shown to be elevated in db/db mice (Connor et al. 2010; Salek et al. 2007) but decreased in Zucker rats (Salek et al. 2007; William s et al. 2006b; Zhao et al. 2010a), whereas microbiota9derived methylamines such as dimethylamine or tr imethylamine9 N9oxide were shown to be increased in both types of rodents (Connor et al. 2010; Gipson et al. 2008; Salek et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2008; Zhao et al. 2010a). Reasons for t his discrepancy may be related to differences in the composition of the intesti nal microflora. HUMAN STUDIES APPLIED TO GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND DIA BETES Glucose ingestion The OGTT measures the body\u2019s ability to metabolise glucose and clear exc ess glucose from the bloodstream. Since the 1970s, the OGTT has been a standard diagnostic tool i n Page 12 of 33 13diabetology. A 29h OGTT is routinely performed in fasting patients; pati ents drink a beverage containing a specific amount of glucose according to their body weight, and 2 h after the glucose load, the blood glucose concentration is measured and provides inf ormation on glucose tolerance. According to the WHO , in healthy individuals, the venous plasma glucose level should be below 7.8 mmol/l; values greater than this can be used to diagnose i mpaired glucose tolerance (7.8 9 11.1 mmol/l) or diabetes mellitus (\u226511.1 mmol/l) (World Health Organization 2006) . Several studies have investigated changes in the metabolic profile in relation to glucose ingestion (Matysik, et al. 2011; Shaham et al. 2008; Spegel, et al. 2010; Zhao, et al. 2009). An investigation (Shaham et al. 2008) among participants in the Metabolic Abnormalities in College Students (MACS) study who demonstrated normal glucose tolerance revealed significant kinetic alterations in 21 out of 191 plasma metabolites, as m easured by LC9MS, in response to an OGTT.

Eighteen of these metabolites were independently identif ied in subjects from the Framingham Offspring Study, and several metabol ites, including glucose, lactate, hippurate and glycerol, had also been previously related to gluc ose metabolism (Pelkonen, et al. 1967). However, this study demonstrated novel changes in the l evels of bile acids following the OGTT; the levels of three bile acids, glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), w ere increased within the first 30 min following glucose ingestion and remained st able thereafter. Another study (Zhao et al. 2009) examining healthy individuals revealed similar r esults concerning these bile acids and reported as much as a 69fold increase in these level s after 30 min (followed by a subsequent decrease). Both findings were confirmed by a thir d study (Matysik et al. 2011) that investigated bile acid signalling during the cours e of an OGTT in relation to 15 conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. In normal subjects, the level s of GCDCA, the bile acid with the highest plasma levels, and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) increased within the first 60 min of the OGTT. Furthermore, this study found that in response to oral glucose ingestion, the levels of all of the examined glycine9 and taurine9conjugated bile acids were increased at 60 min and declined slightly over the following 60 min, whereas Page 13 of 33 14the levels of unconjugated bile acids, e.g., cholic acid, lithocholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, declined throughout the course of the OGTT. Bile acids are produced in the liver by the oxidation of cholesterol and are stored in the gall bladder. Upon food intake, bile ac ids are released into the duodenum and small intestine and facilitate the intesti nal absorption of nutrients, particularly dietary fat, drugs and steroids. The majorit y of excreted bile acids are reabsorbed in the terminal ileum and return to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation, and very low levels of bile acids are found in the systemic circulation. Beside their major role in dietary lipid absorption, bile acids are metabolic factors that play regulatory roles in fat, glucose and energy metabolism (Houten, et al. 2006; Lefebvre, et al. 2009). The report ed increase in bile acids in response to glucose ingestion is in concordance with a 3 9fold increase in the levels of bile acids in human serum following a standard liqui d meal (De Barros, et al. 1982). Furthermore, oral glucose ingestion leads to increased lev els of cholecystokinin, a hormone that stimulates the production of hepatic bile and gal l bladder contractions (Liddle, et al. 1985). The link between bile acids and glucose homeostas is was further confirmed by the demonstration of enhanced CYP7A1 mRNA expressi on following insulin injection or oral glucose administration in fasting mice (Li, et al. 2012).

The link between bile acids and glucose homeostas is was further confirmed by the demonstration of enhanced CYP7A1 mRNA expressi on following insulin injection or oral glucose administration in fasting mice (Li, et al. 2012). Additionally, in primary human hepatocytes, insulin and glucose were shown to stimulate CYP7A1 mRNA expression (Li, et al. 2010b; Li, et al. 2006), which suggests the existence of glucose/insulin9 regulated gene transcription in the liver. The CYP7A1 gene encodes the enzyme c holesterol 7\u03b19hydroxylase, which is the rate9limiting enzyme in the cholesterol catabolic pathway and the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids and therefore represents a major point of regulation during bile acid synthesis. The direct glucose/insulin9stimulated ex pression of CYP7A1 leads to an increased bile acid pool size. Taken together, these findings indicate an important connection between bile acid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. He nce, it is not surprising that the bile acid metabolism is altered in patients w ith diabetes (Prawitt, et al. 2011). In addition, a metabonomic study revealed higher plasma levels of GCDC A in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, as compared to subjects with normal glucose tolerance (Zhao, et al. 2010b). Another study detected differences in the compo sition of the Page 14 of 33 15bile acid pool between T2DM patients and controls (Brufau, et al. 2010). Wher eas the size of the total bile acid pool was not different, T2DM subjects demonstrated increased deoxycholic acid input rates and cholic acid synthesis rates but exhibited a lower proportion o f CDCA. Furthermore, therapy with bile acid sequestrants leads to the expected reductions i n both total cholesterol and low9density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as i mprovements in glycaemic control in T2DM patients (Garg and Grundy 1994; Kondo and Kadowaki 2010; Suzuki, et al. 2006; Zieve, et al. 2007). Compared to patients who received co ntrol treatments or placebos, T2DM patients given bile acid sequestrants demonstrat ed greater reductions in the levels of plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin. In regards to the OGTT studies, metabolites beside bile acids were also altered during the OGTT in healthy subjects. In fact, increases in lysophosphatidylcholine (Z hao et al. 2009) and decreases in amino acids (Table 1) (Shaham et al. 2008; Spegel et al. 2010) , acylcarnitines (Zhao et al. 2009) and fatty acids (Table 2) (Spegel et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2009) were reported. The study by Zhao et al. (Zhao et al. 2009) provided a mor e systematic overview of fatty acid plasma changes during an OGTT; although the levels of f atty acids declined during an OGTT, the levels of saturated (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) were more significantly decreased than those of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Moreover, a substantial reduction in the SFA/MUFA ratio was observed, consisting of a shift from MUFA towards SFA. These findings indicate a change in fatty acid composition following an OGTT.

Moreover, a substantial reduction in the SFA/MUFA ratio was observed, consisting of a shift from MUFA towards SFA. These findings indicate a change in fatty acid composition following an OGTT. A more detailed discussion on this topic is presente d in the next chapter. Overall, metabolic studies have revealed alterations in metabolites relat ed to pathways involved in the action of insulin, including lipolysis, ketogenesis, proteo lysis and glucose metabolism. These results indicate a change from beta9oxidation to glyc olysis and fat storage in response to glucose ingestion. Patient investigations Comparisons between the levels of various metabolites in diabetic patients and healthy controls have confirmed many of the findings from animal studies as well as studies Page 15 of 33 16investigating metabolic changes during an OGTT. These findings from human patient s can be summarised as follows: 1) As expected, diabetic patients exhibited differences in glucose metabolism . Patients with T1DM under insulin deprivation (Lanza, et al. 2010) or in T2DM (Li, et al. 2009; Suhre, et al. 2010) demonstrated elevated glucose or mannose levels as compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, in both T1DM and T2DM patients (Messana, et al. 1998; Zuppi, et al. 2002) increased lactate levels were observed, at which thes e levels increased with the grade of glucosuria in T2DM patients (Messana et al . 1998). 2) With respect to TCA cycle metabolites (and similar to db/db mice), patients with T1DM (Zuppi et al. 2002) and T2DM (Messana et al. 1998) had higher levels of ci trate, and these levels were also associated with increasing glucosuria (Messana et al. 1998). An additional study investigated the metabolic profiles of children w ho later progressed to T1DM and found decreased succinate and citrate levels at the tim e of birth (Oresic, et al. 2008). 3) The above9mentioned results were further confirmed in regards to the levels of ketone bodies during diabetes. Higher levels of acetone, acetoacetate and \u03b29 hydroxybutyrate were observed in insulin9deprived T1DM (Lanza et al. 2010) and T2DM (Messana et al. 1998; Nicholson et al. 1984; Suhre et al. 2010) subjects, indicating ketoacidotic metabolic decompensation. 4) Additionally, alterations in intestinal microflora9associated metabolit es have been detected. Insulin9deprived T1DM and T2DM patients exhibited elevated levels of hippurate, dimethylamine or trimethylamine9N9oxide (Messana et al. 1998; Zuppi et al. 2002), although a separate study observed lower levels of hippurate and 39 hydroxyhippurate among pre9diabetic individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (Zhao et al. 2010b). The human gut microbiota has an important role in health, which has been comprehensively discussed by several authors (Fujimura, et al. 2010; Nicholson et al. 2005; Prakash, et al. 2011) and is outside the focus of t he present review. Page 16 of 33 17Fatty acid alterations in patients with diabetes have been extensively exa mined.

In accordance with genetic rat models (Salek et al. 2007; Williams et al. 2006b), increased fatty acid levels were detected in T2DM patients (Li et al. 2009; Suhre et al. 20 10; Yi, et al. 2007; Yi, et al. 2008; Yi, et al. 2006) as well as in subjects with impaired gl ucose tolerance (Zhao et al. 2010b). Changes in as many as 18 fatty acids, including SFA, MUFA and PUFA, were found in one study. Furthermore, the metabolic profile of plasma acylcarni tines revealed higher fasting levels of long9chain saturated and monounsaturated acylcarnitines in obese and T2DM subjects as compared to lean controls (Mihalik, et al. 2010). M oreover, the levels of free carnitine were increased in both groups, although differences betw een groups were observed for short9 and medium9chain acylcarnitine species as well as hydr oxyacylcarnitines, where higher levels were observed in T2DM patients. Similar to an OGTT9induced reduction in acylcarnitines (Zhao et al. 2009), an insulin9stimulated euglycaemic clamp led to a decrease in all acylcarnitine species for all three of the investigated groups, although this reduction was blunted in patients with T2DM (Mihalik et al. 2010). All of the investigated fatty acids and acylcarnitines are listed in table 2. Many studies have demonstr ated that obese subjects often exhibit elevated fatty acid levels due to the enlarged volu me of adipose tissue (Jensen, et al. 1989; Newgard et al. 2009; Opie and Walfish 1963). Furthermore, higher levels of fatty acids are related to a greater risk for diabetes (Charl es, et al. 1997; Pankow, et al. 2004; Paolisso, et al. 1995), although the underlying mechanisms are not compl etely understood. However, elevated levels of free fatty acids induce insulin re sistance in muscle and liver tissue by decreasing insulin9stimulated glucose uptake and glycogenesis (Boden 2003; Griffin, et al. 1999; Wilding 2007). Moreover, the improvement in insulin sensitivity caused by a reduction in fatty acid levels supports these findings (Boden, et al. 1998; Cusi, et al. 2007; Santomauro, et al. 1999). At present, there are several hypotheses as to how free fatty acids interfere with insulin signalling; these are related to oxidative stress or inflammatory lipid pathways and have been reviewed by Boden (Boden 2011). An additional observation from patient studies is the change in amino acid levels in diabetic patients. A broad range of amino acids, including leucine, isoleucine, valine, pheny lalanine, Page 17 of 33 18tyrosine, alanine, tryptophan and homocitrulline, has been shown to be substantially increased in T1DM (Lanza et al. 2010) or T2DM patients (Messana et al. 1998; S uhre et al. 2010) as well as among subjects with obesity (Newgard et al. 2009) or impai red glucose tolerance (Zhao et al. 2010b). In addition, these findings have been confirmed by st udies that revealed positive associations between amino acid levels and the homeostasi s model assessment index (Newgard et al. 2009) and"

In addition, these findings have been confirmed by st udies that revealed positive associations between amino acid levels and the homeostasi s model assessment index (Newgard et al. 2009) and insulin resistance of obese subjects , according to Bergman\u2019s minimal model (Huffman, et al. 2009). However, lower lev els of glycine, glutamate and threonine have been observed in diabetic patients and obese subjects (Lanza et al. 2010; Messana et al. 1998; Newgard et al. 2009). A recent investigation (W ang, et al. 2011) of the Framingham Offspring Study firstly examined the predict ive ability of fasting plasma metabolite levels for incident T2DM and showed that the amino acids i soleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine were elevated 12 years prior to the ons et of diabetes and were also linked to a higher diabetes risk. In fact, the combinati on of increased fasting isoleucine, tyrosine and phenylalanine levels at baseline was related to a gre ater than 59fold higher risk of incident diabetes. Moreover, these results were independent ly replicated in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study. These studies have highlighted the impact of amino acids on the actions of insulin and consequently glucose metabolism. In the 1940s , Luetscher (Luetscher 1942) already reported higher amino acid levels among diabet ic patients, and this finding was later confirmed by the demonstration of the posit ive correlation between amino acid levels and insulin (Felig, et al. 1969). Furthermore, the intravenous administration of amino acids leads to the stimulation of insulin s ecretion. This insulinotropic effect differs depending on the specific amino acids in question (Floyd, et al. 1966; Floyd, et al. 1968). However, the underlying mechanisms are complex and are related to the inhibition of glucose transport and gluconeogenesis (Krebs, et al. 2002; Langenberg and Savage 2011; Patti, et al. 1998). Page 18 of 33 19CONCLUSION AND CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTRUE The application of metabolomics in diabetes studies has rapidly evolved during the las t decade and provides researchers with the opportunity to gain new insights in metaboli c profiling and pathophysiological mechanisms. Thus, several metabolites were identified to be related to diabetes or insulin resistance and represent the basis for the identification of novel diabetes biomarkers. Some findings were newly discovered altered metabolites e.g. bile acids, whereas other metabolic variations were already known e.g. fatty ac ids or amino acids. However, the results often led to a revalue of knowledge. Langenberg and colleague (Langenberg and Savage 2011) currently discuss the potential of an amino acid profile as predictor of T2DM and highlighted the fact that the addition of amino acids t o established risk factors only minimal improved the risk predication. This general problem is also apparent for genetic variants and other clinical novel biomarkers of diabetes whose power to add considerable improvement in risk assessment is limited (Lyssenko, et al. 2008; Meigs, et al. 2008; Salomaa, et al. 2010)."
