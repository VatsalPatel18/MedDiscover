Zhou ||| Abstract | Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases worldwide and is often associated with aspects of metabolic syndrome. Despite its prevalence and the importance of early diagnosis, there is a lack of robustly validated biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease progression in response to a given treatment. In this Review, we provide an overview of the contribution of metabolomics and lipidomics in clinical studies to identify biomarkers associated with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In addition, we highlight the key metabolic pathways in NAFLD and NASH that have been identified by metabolomics and lipidomics approaches and could potentially be used as biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostic tests. Overall, the studies demonstrated alterations in amino acid metabolism and several aspects of lipid metabolism including circulating fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids and bile acids. Although we report several studies that identified potential biomarkers, few have been validated. ✉e-mail: Mojgan.Masoodi@ insel.ch; Matej.Oresic@oru.se https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41575-021-00502-9 REVIEWS NATure revIeWS | GASTROeNTeROLOG y & HePATOLOG y volume 18 | December 2021 | 835 0123456789();: steatosis. However, there is still a great demand to estab- lish and validate other biomarkers that predict NASH progression and/or response to treatment. Based on this demand, the Innovative Medicines Initiative Consortium ‘Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis’ (IMI2 LITMUS) aims to develop, validate and advance towards qualification of biomarkers for testing NAFLD across a range of contexts of use. Different methodologies are consid- ered to be part of this aim, and metabolomics is one of these approaches. The metabolomics approach is a comprehensive biochemical profiling technique, built upon decades of fundamental research in biochemistry, physiology, analytical chemistry and bioinformatics. As the human plasma lipidome is enormously diverse and complex 14, lipidomics has emerged as a related subfield of metabolomics, aiming to comprehensively character - ize different molecular lipid species in biological systems as well as to investigate their function15. Metabolomics aims to assess metabolism and identify downstream functions of genes and proteins. The chemical and bio- logical diversity of the metabolome is enormous16. This diversity requires several analytical strategies, with an extensive array of techniques, to cover a wide range of metabolites while ensuring data output quality (Fig. 1).

The last one is the gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD, butthis method is invasive and expensive and lots of subjects with suspected NAFLD are reluctant to use it as a diagnostic approach. Other traditional non-invasive methods men- tioned above are not precise and sometimes cannot detect the patients with NAFLD (9). Thus, these challenges moti- vated researchers to ﬁnd a non-invasive method with high accuracy for early detection of NAFLD. In the recent decades, “omics” technologies such as metabolomics, the newest member in the “omics” ap- proaches have provided an opportunity to ﬁnd diagnostic biomarkers, clarify the underling mechanisms, and eval- uate the treatment of various diseases using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas/liquid chromatogra- phy mass spectrometry (GC/LC-MS) (10-12).

Objectives The present study was conducted to evaluate whether NMR-based metabolomics may detect patients with NAFLD compared to healthy controls in Iranian population. 3. Methods 3.1. Study Population Metabolomic analyses were performed on 37 NAFLD pa- tients and on 36 healthy controls. Subjects with NAFLD were enrolled in the study (between January and August 2017) from 22 bahman hospital (Neyshabur, Iran). The NAFLD patients had been newly diagnosed based on hep- atic ultrasound. Among 37 NAFLD patients, 8 patients had hyperlipidemia and 3 patients had high blood pressure; therefore, these subjects received medications associated with their disorders. The control group included the vol- unteers who underwent medical checkups and were veri- ﬁed to have normal liver function. Healthy controls were matched for age and gender with the patient group. To ver- ify the absence of steatosis, all healthy controls also per- formed hepatic ultrasound. Blood sample was taken under fasting conditions form each participant in the morning. Serum samples were sep- arated and were stored in aliquots at -80°C until use. The inclusion criteria were: (i) age between 22 - 63 years old; (ii) non-smoker and non-alcoholic people (intake of alco- hol for women and men was less than 20 and 30 mg/d, re- spectively) and exclusion criteria were: (i) having acute or chronic liver disorders including viral and autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease and other metabolic liver disorders such as hemochromatosis and Wilson’s disease; (ii) having other medical disorders such as diabetes mel- litus, hyper/hypothyroidism, cancer, cardiovascular dis- eases (iii) being pregnant and lactating women. The present study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences (IR.NUMS.REC.1395.33). A consent form was obtained from all the participants before enrollment in the study . 3.2.

Objectives The present study was conducted to evaluate whether NMR-based metabolomics may detect patients with NAFLD compared to healthy controls in Iranian population. 3. Methods 3.1. Study Population Metabolomic analyses were performed on 37 NAFLD pa- tients and on 36 healthy controls. Subjects with NAFLD were enrolled in the study (between January and August 2017) from 22 bahman hospital (Neyshabur, Iran). The NAFLD patients had been newly diagnosed based on hep- atic ultrasound. Among 37 NAFLD patients, 8 patients had hyperlipidemia and 3 patients had high blood pressure; therefore, these subjects received medications associated with their disorders. The control group included the vol- unteers who underwent medical checkups and were veri- ﬁed to have normal liver function. Healthy controls were matched for age and gender with the patient group. To ver- ify the absence of steatosis, all healthy controls also per- formed hepatic ultrasound. Blood sample was taken under fasting conditions form each participant in the morning. Serum samples were sep- arated and were stored in aliquots at -80°C until use. The inclusion criteria were: (i) age between 22 - 63 years old; (ii) non-smoker and non-alcoholic people (intake of alco- hol for women and men was less than 20 and 30 mg/d, re- spectively) and exclusion criteria were: (i) having acute or chronic liver disorders including viral and autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease and other metabolic liver disorders such as hemochromatosis and Wilson’s disease; (ii) having other medical disorders such as diabetes mel- litus, hyper/hypothyroidism, cancer, cardiovascular dis- eases (iii) being pregnant and lactating women. The present study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences (IR.NUMS.REC.1395.33).

Zhou ||| Abstract | Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases worldwide and is often associated with aspects of metabolic syndrome. Despite its prevalence and the importance of early diagnosis, there is a lack of robustly validated biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease progression in response to a given treatment. In this Review, we provide an overview of the contribution of metabolomics and lipidomics in clinical studies to identify biomarkers associated with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In addition, we highlight the key metabolic pathways in NAFLD and NASH that have been identified by metabolomics and lipidomics approaches and could potentially be used as biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostic tests. Overall, the studies demonstrated alterations in amino acid metabolism and several aspects of lipid metabolism including circulating fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids and bile acids. Although we report several studies that identified potential biomarkers, few have been validated. ✉e-mail: Mojgan.Masoodi@ insel.ch; Matej.Oresic@oru.se https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41575-021-00502-9 REVIEWS NATure revIeWS | GASTROeNTeROLOG y & HePATOLOG y volume 18 | December 2021 | 835 0123456789();: steatosis. However, there is still a great demand to estab- lish and validate other biomarkers that predict NASH progression and/or response to treatment. Based on this demand, the Innovative Medicines Initiative Consortium ‘Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis’ (IMI2 LITMUS) aims to develop, validate and advance towards qualification of biomarkers for testing NAFLD across a range of contexts of use. Different methodologies are consid- ered to be part of this aim, and metabolomics is one of these approaches. The metabolomics approach is a comprehensive biochemical profiling technique, built upon decades of fundamental research in biochemistry, physiology, analytical chemistry and bioinformatics. As the human plasma lipidome is enormously diverse and complex 14, lipidomics has emerged as a related subfield of metabolomics, aiming to comprehensively character - ize different molecular lipid species in biological systems as well as to investigate their function15. Metabolomics aims to assess metabolism and identify downstream functions of genes and proteins. The chemical and bio- logical diversity of the metabolome is enormous16. This diversity requires several analytical strategies, with an extensive array of techniques, to cover a wide range of metabolites while ensuring data output quality (Fig. 1). The advantages and limitations of different analytical approaches are summarized in TaBle 1.Genome-scale metabolic modelling has emerged as a powerful approach that can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of disease progression, and it has been used to attempt to identify biomarkers and underlying pathways for NAFLD–NASH 17–19. Genome- scale metabolic models (GSMMs), as a scaffold, connect metabolic genes and their products (that is, enzymes) with metabolic pathways. Moreover, GSMMs can be constrained and contextualized with multi-‘omics’ data - sets, thereby connecting an organism’s genotype to its phenotype. Using GSMMs one can study changes in the global metabolic network topology, evaluate metabolite flux distribution, and predict uptake and secretion of specific metabolites 20.

Despite its prevalence and the importance of early diagnosis, there is a lack of robustly validated biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease progression in response to a given treatment. In this Review, we provide an overview of the contribution of metabolomics and lipidomics in clinical studies to identify biomarkers associated with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In addition, we highlight the key metabolic pathways in NAFLD and NASH that have been identified by metabolomics and lipidomics approaches and could potentially be used as biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostic tests. Overall, the studies demonstrated alterations in amino acid metabolism and several aspects of lipid metabolism including circulating fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids and bile acids. Although we report several studies that identified potential biomarkers, few have been validated. ✉e-mail: Mojgan.Masoodi@ insel.ch; Matej.Oresic@oru.se https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41575-021-00502-9 REVIEWS NATure revIeWS | GASTROeNTeROLOG y & HePATOLOG y volume 18 | December 2021 | 835 0123456789();: steatosis. However, there is still a great demand to estab- lish and validate other biomarkers that predict NASH progression and/or response to treatment. Based on this demand, the Innovative Medicines Initiative Consortium ‘Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis’ (IMI2 LITMUS) aims to develop, validate and advance towards qualification of biomarkers for testing NAFLD across a range of contexts of use. Different methodologies are consid- ered to be part of this aim, and metabolomics is one of these approaches. The metabolomics approach is a comprehensive biochemical profiling technique, built upon decades of fundamental research in biochemistry, physiology, analytical chemistry and bioinformatics. As the human plasma lipidome is enormously diverse and complex 14, lipidomics has emerged as a related subfield of metabolomics, aiming to comprehensively character - ize different molecular lipid species in biological systems as well as to investigate their function15. Metabolomics aims to assess metabolism and identify downstream functions of genes and proteins. The chemical and bio- logical diversity of the metabolome is enormous16. This diversity requires several analytical strategies, with an extensive array of techniques, to cover a wide range of metabolites while ensuring data output quality (Fig. 1). The advantages and limitations of different analytical approaches are summarized in TaBle 1.Genome-scale metabolic modelling has emerged as a powerful approach that can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of disease progression, and it has been used to attempt to identify biomarkers and underlying pathways for NAFLD–NASH 17–19. Genome- scale metabolic models (GSMMs), as a scaffold, connect metabolic genes and their products (that is, enzymes) with metabolic pathways. Moreover, GSMMs can be constrained and contextualized with multi-‘omics’ data - sets, thereby connecting an organism’s genotype to its phenotype. Using GSMMs one can study changes in the global metabolic network topology, evaluate metabolite flux distribution, and predict uptake and secretion of specific metabolites 20. In this Review, we evaluate the use of metabolomics and lipidomics, in clinical studies to identify biomark-ers associated with NAFLD and ||| for large numbers of gut microbial species 183. Application of genome-scale metabolic modelling on shotgun metagenomics data from stool samples can predict which metabolites are being produced in spe-cific diseases or physiological conditions 184. Such predic - tions can be validated by stool and serum metabolomics. Adding different layers of omics data is thus likely to lead to both improved sensitivity as well as specificity of NAFLD–NASH biomarkers. However, clinical vali-dation and translation of multimodal diagnostic tools might prove more challenging than only a single layer, both technologically as well as from the health econom-ics perspective. Nevertheless, adding multiple layers of data will enrich our knowledge about the complex pathophysiology of NAFLD–NASH and is expected to facilitate our search for biomarker candidates with the greatest sensitivity and specificity.

The last one is the gold standard for diagnosis of NAFLD, butthis method is invasive and expensive and lots of subjects with suspected NAFLD are reluctant to use it as a diagnostic approach. Other traditional non-invasive methods men- tioned above are not precise and sometimes cannot detect the patients with NAFLD (9). Thus, these challenges moti- vated researchers to ﬁnd a non-invasive method with high accuracy for early detection of NAFLD. In the recent decades, “omics” technologies such as metabolomics, the newest member in the “omics” ap- proaches have provided an opportunity to ﬁnd diagnostic biomarkers, clarify the underling mechanisms, and eval- uate the treatment of various diseases using the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas/liquid chromatogra- phy mass spectrometry (GC/LC-MS) (10-12).

Objectives The present study was conducted to evaluate whether NMR-based metabolomics may detect patients with NAFLD compared to healthy controls in Iranian population. 3. Methods 3.1. Study Population Metabolomic analyses were performed on 37 NAFLD pa- tients and on 36 healthy controls. Subjects with NAFLD were enrolled in the study (between January and August 2017) from 22 bahman hospital (Neyshabur, Iran). The NAFLD patients had been newly diagnosed based on hep- atic ultrasound. Among 37 NAFLD patients, 8 patients had hyperlipidemia and 3 patients had high blood pressure; therefore, these subjects received medications associated with their disorders. The control group included the vol- unteers who underwent medical checkups and were veri- ﬁed to have normal liver function. Healthy controls were matched for age and gender with the patient group. To ver- ify the absence of steatosis, all healthy controls also per- formed hepatic ultrasound. Blood sample was taken under fasting conditions form each participant in the morning. Serum samples were sep- arated and were stored in aliquots at -80°C until use. The inclusion criteria were: (i) age between 22 - 63 years old; (ii) non-smoker and non-alcoholic people (intake of alco- hol for women and men was less than 20 and 30 mg/d, re- spectively) and exclusion criteria were: (i) having acute or chronic liver disorders including viral and autoimmune hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease and other metabolic liver disorders such as hemochromatosis and Wilson’s disease; (ii) having other medical disorders such as diabetes mel- litus, hyper/hypothyroidism, cancer, cardiovascular dis- eases (iii) being pregnant and lactating women. The present study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences (IR.NUMS.REC.1395.33). A consent form was obtained from all the participants before enrollment in the study . 3.2. Anthropometric and Biochemical Parameters Body height and weight were measured with ||| be outside the 99% Hotelling’s T2conﬁdence limit and were removed for further analysis (Appendix A and B). Af- ter removing two outliers, the ﬁnal PCA was performed (Figure 1A: R2X = 0.857, Q2= 0.729). Then, the OPLS-DA was performed to identify potential metabolic biomarkers between the two study groups (Figure 1B: R2X = 0.67, R2Y = 0.982, Q2= 0.924). The loading plot of OPLS-DA model has been illustrated in Figure 1C. This loading plot demon- strated the chemical shifts of the NMR spectra that are re- sponsible for clustering in OPLS-DA score plot. To validate the OPLS-DA model ROC curve was used, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value was 0.99 for the OPLS-DA model (Fig- ure 1D). 4.3. Metabolite Identiﬁcation and Pathway Analysis of Altered Proﬁles Our ﬁndings showed nineteen diﬀerent metabolites that were recognized based on the literatures and on- line databases. Chemical shifts and signal multiplicity were used for identiﬁcation of metabolites. Compared to healthy controls, NAFLD patients had increased serum con- centrations of glycochenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, glycocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, valine, isoleucine, succinic acid, isocitric acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid, trimethy- lamine, proline, hydroxyproline and tyrosine, while the concentrations of butyric acid, propionic acid, isovaleric acid, glutamine, glycine, and serine decreased (Table 2). Pathway analysis was performed on metabolites detected via NMR analysis using the MetaboAnalyst 3.0 servers. This software showed eleven metabolic path- ways changed in serum of patients with NAFLD. These pathways included aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, pri- mary bile acid biosynthesis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, methane metabolism, propanoate metabolism, D-glutamine and D- glutamate metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, butanoate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, cyanoamino acid metabolism (Figure 2 and Table 3). 5. Discussion NAFLD is associated with the obesity and alterations in life style aﬀecting many body systems (17). Nevertheless, the pathogenesis is multifactorial and not clearly realized.

Metabolomics Experiments Multivariate statistical analyses were carried out by SIMCA (SIMCA 14.0, Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden). All variables (chemical shifts along with confounding factors) were im- ported into the SIMCA. First, unsupervised principal com- ponent analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters and out- liers in the dataset. Then, supervised orthogonal projec- tions to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was applied to recognize diﬀerentiation chemical shifts between healthy controls and NAFLD patients. The model quality was described by three parameters (R2X, R2Y and Q2). Moreover, the model prediction performance was eval- uated by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve that generated from seven-fold cross validation obtained by SIMCA. 3.5. Metabolite Identiﬁcation The metabolites were recognized based on litera- tures and on-line databases such as human metabolome database (HMDB) (http://hmdb.ca/) and biological mag- netic resonance databank (BMRB) (http://bmrb.wisc.edu) according to their chemical shifts obtained by OPLS-DA model. 3.6. Metabolic Pathway Analysis Metabolite pathway analysis were performed using MetaboAnalyst 3.0. The discriminant metabolites between healthy controls and NAFLD patients were imported into the MetaboAnalyst software (17) in order to seek signiﬁcant metabolic pathways involved in this disease. The P value and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were considered sta- tistically signiﬁcant. 4. Results 4.1. Clinical Patient Characteristics In this study , we analyzed the metabolic proﬁles of 75 serum samples collected from 37 healthy controls and 38 patients with NAFLD for NMR analysis (two samples were identiﬁed as outliers and deleted from analysis) that their anthropometric and biochemical parameters were summarized in Table 1. Of the 37 participants, 19 were with grade 1 and 18 with grade 2. In the NAFLD and con- trol groups, the gender ratio showed no signiﬁcant diﬀer- ence. Age and height were similar in the NAFLD and con- trol groups, whereas body weight and BMI were signiﬁ- cantly higher in the NAFLD than in the control group. Also, NAFLD patients had signiﬁcantly higher levels of serum to- tal cholesterol, triglycerides and hepatic enzymes includ- ing alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase compared to the healthy con- trols (Table 1).4.2. Discrimination Between NAFLD and Control Groups Using Multivariate Analysis The obtained matrix containing the numbers of sam- ples and 409 variables (408 chemical shifts along with BMI as confounding factor) was imported into SIMCA and ana- lyzed using unsupervised PCA for detecting outliers. The PCA scoter plot showed two serum samples were found to be outside the 99% Hotelling’s T2conﬁdence limit and were removed for further analysis (Appendix A and B). Af- ter removing two outliers, the ﬁnal PCA was performed (Figure 1A: R2X = 0.857, Q2= 0.729).

With the advances of analytical techniques and statistical approaches, the number of measurable metabolites has been increasing exponentially over the past 10 years (from 2200 to around 1 million currently) [21]. The application of metabolomics in diabetes and its complications, especially in large-scale epidemiological studies, has facilitated the identification and validation of metabolites that can serve as screening and prognostic biomarkers. Moreover, a multi-omics approach, combining metabolomics with other “omics” data, can provide insights into the complex intercorrelations of different axes in- volved in the disease and provide opportunities to elucidate the potential causality be- tween biomarkers and disease. The current review focuses on me tabolomic biomarkers for kidney and cardiovascular disease in T2D identified from epidemiological studies, and will also provide a brief over view on metabolomic biomarkers for T2D identified in pro- spective studies. In the following section, we firstly introduce the analytical methods for metabolic profiling. 3. Analytical Methods 3.1. Untargeted and Targeted Metabolomics There are two analytical approaches for me tabolomics studies: untargeted and tar- geted. Untargeted metabolomics represents the unbiased appr oach to complete profiling of the metabolome, aiming to detect, identify , and quantify as many metabolites in a bio- logical sample as possible. The major strength of untargeted metabolomics is the possibil-ity of uncovering novel biom arkers and pathophysiological pathways of disease. How- ever, the annotation of unknown compounds often becomes a challenge, given the wide coverage of signals. In contrast, targeted me tabolomics aims to meas ure a prespecified set or cluster of chemical compounds, which ar e usually lying on the same metabolic path- ways or are structurally similar. Although only capable of provid ing limited information on the metabolic profiling, targeted metabolomics in general has higher sensitivity and selectivity, and can often provide a deeper understanding of the selected metabolites. 3.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy In sharp contrast to the genome, which comprises of only four nucleotide bases, or the proteome, which represents the different co mbinations of 20 proteogenic amino acids, the metabolome consists of chemical comp ounds belonging to thousands of different chemical classes [22] (Figure 1). Given the di verse chemical properties and the wide range Figure 1. Metabolomics provide a comprehensive molecular proﬁle of a phenotype by integrating both endogenous and exogenous information. Metabolites are the downstream products of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and enzymatic reactions, which are also affected by environmental exposures, such as environmental pollution, physical activities, medications, and diet. The metabolome is closely correlated with genes in which even one single base change in a protein-coding gene can result in 10,000-fold change in the level of a metabolite. In contrast to the relatively simple chemical constitutions of genome (4 nucleotide bases) and proteome (20 proteogenic amino acids), the metabolome consists of thousands of different chemical classes and the number of metabolites is estimated to be around 1 million, while the number of genes and proteins are about 20,000 and ||| studies [26]. More speci ﬁcally, metabolomics has a global and non-invasive analysis of biomarkers that are indicators of pathogenic process, or response to therapeutic intervention, thereby helping to monitor treatment response [27]. Recently, panels of multiple biomarkers re ﬂecting T2D pathologies have been developed. A variety of biomarkers representing various pathophysiological pathways of insulin resistance, have also been investigated [28]. The number of T2D patients has recently been increasing worldwide. Thus, the discovery of potential T2D biomarkers, leading to the earlydetection and/or prevention of diabetes mellitus, is strongly required. The term biomarker was de ﬁned by the National Institutes of Health as a “characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or phar- macologic responses to a therapeutic intervention ”. These include lipids, sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, organic acids, and many other low-molecular-weight compounds [29]. These small molecular metabolites could yield important information about a person's health or disease, Fig. 1. The general procedures in metabolomic can be used for biomarker discovery.107 A. Zhang et al. / Clinica Chimica Acta 429 (2014) 106 –110 some of which may be molecular targets for therapeutic intervention [30]. Metabolomics in diabetes has provided researchers much knowl- edge and the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pathwaysand pathophysiological mechanisms. Several potential metabolic bio- markers and related metabolic pathways have been identi ﬁed and are currently being investigated and validated in T2D patients, such as 3-hydroxybutyrate with ketogenisis and altered bile acids [31]. Further- more, metabolomics studies conducted on human subjects between di- abetic patients and healthy controls revealed many important altered metabolic pathways and metabolic variations. Metabolomics increased our knowledge of the dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with progression of diseases and provided potentially new therapeutic strategies targeting these dysregulated pathways, though our under- standing about the distinct and complete metabolic footprints of T2D [32]. 4. Bringing metabolomics into T2D research Advantages of metabolomics over other “omics ”, include its high sensitivity and its ability to enable the analysis of relatively fewmetabolites compared with the unwieldy number of corresponding genes or mRNA molecules. There is mounting evidence that metabolo-mics can provide important insight into biomarker discoveries and the pathogenic nature of various diseases and a great deal of research on diabetes has been conducted with clinical human subjects during the last decade [33,34] . Given that the overall health status of an individual is captured by his or her metabolic state, metabolomics promises toimprove current, single metabolites-based clinical assessments by identifying metabolic signatures that embody global biochemical changes in disease. Metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools are being used to map potential biomarkers for T2D [35]. Application of metabolomics in T2D studies has rapidly evolved during the last decade and provides researchers the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pro ﬁling and pathophysiological mechanisms. Thus, several metabolites were identi ﬁed to be related to T2D or insulin resistance and represent the basis for the identi ﬁcation of novel diabetes biomarkers [36].

Untargeted metabolomics represents the unbiased approach to complete proﬁling of the metabolome, aiming to detect, identify, and quantify as many metabolites in a biological sample as possible. The major strength of untargeted metabolomics is the possibility of uncovering novel biomarkers and pathophysiological pathways of disease.

In contrast, targeted metabolomics aims to measure a prespeciﬁed set or clus- ter of chemical compounds, which are usually lying on the same metabolic pathways or are structurally similar. Although only capable of providing limited information on the metabolic proﬁling, targeted metabolomics in general has higher sensitivity and selectivity, and can often provide a deeper understanding of the selected metabolites. 3.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy In sharp contrast to the genome, which comprises of only four nucleotide bases, or the proteome, which represents the different combinations of 20 proteogenic amino acids, the metabolome consists of chemical compounds belonging to thousands of different chemical classes [ 22] (Figure 1).

In the following section, we firstly introduce the analytical methods for metabolic profiling. 3. Analytical Methods 3.1. Untargeted and Targeted Metabolomics There are two analytical approaches for me tabolomics studies: untargeted and tar- geted. Untargeted metabolomics represents the unbiased appr oach to complete profiling of the metabolome, aiming to detect, identify , and quantify as many metabolites in a bio- logical sample as possible. The major strength of untargeted metabolomics is the possibil-ity of uncovering novel biom arkers and pathophysiological pathways of disease. How- ever, the annotation of unknown compounds often becomes a challenge, given the wide coverage of signals. In contrast, targeted me tabolomics aims to meas ure a prespecified set or cluster of chemical compounds, which ar e usually lying on the same metabolic path- ways or are structurally similar. Although only capable of provid ing limited information on the metabolic profiling, targeted metabolomics in general has higher sensitivity and selectivity, and can often provide a deeper understanding of the selected metabolites. 3.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy In sharp contrast to the genome, which comprises of only four nucleotide bases, or the proteome, which represents the different co mbinations of 20 proteogenic amino acids, the metabolome consists of chemical comp ounds belonging to thousands of different chemical classes [22] (Figure 1). Given the di verse chemical properties and the wide range Figure 1. Metabolomics provide a comprehensive molecular proﬁle of a phenotype by integrating both endogenous and exogenous information. Metabolites are the downstream products of the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and enzymatic reactions, which are also affected by environmental exposures, such as environmental pollution, physical activities, medications, and diet. The metabolome is closely correlated with genes in which even one single base change in a protein-coding gene can result in 10,000-fold change in the level of a metabolite. In contrast to the relatively simple chemical constitutions of genome (4 nucleotide bases) and proteome (20 proteogenic amino acids), the metabolome consists of thousands of different chemical classes and the number of metabolites is estimated to be around 1 million, while the number of genes and proteins are about 20,000 and ||| studies [26]. More speci ﬁcally, metabolomics has a global and non-invasive analysis of biomarkers that are indicators of pathogenic process, or response to therapeutic intervention, thereby helping to monitor treatment response [27]. Recently, panels of multiple biomarkers re ﬂecting T2D pathologies have been developed. A variety of biomarkers representing various pathophysiological pathways of insulin resistance, have also been investigated [28]. The number of T2D patients has recently been increasing worldwide. Thus, the discovery of potential T2D biomarkers, leading to the earlydetection and/or prevention of diabetes mellitus, is strongly required. The term biomarker was de ﬁned by the National Institutes of Health as a “characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or phar- macologic responses to a therapeutic intervention ”. These include lipids, sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, organic acids, and many other low-molecular-weight compounds [29]. These small molecular metabolites could yield important information about a person's health or disease, Fig. 1. The general procedures in metabolomic can be used for biomarker discovery.107 A. Zhang et al. / Clinica Chimica Acta 429 (2014) 106 –110 some of which may be molecular targets for therapeutic intervention [30]. Metabolomics in diabetes has provided researchers much knowl- edge and the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pathwaysand pathophysiological mechanisms. Several potential metabolic bio- markers and related metabolic pathways have been identi ﬁed and are currently being investigated and validated in T2D patients, such as 3-hydroxybutyrate with ketogenisis and altered bile acids [31]. Further- more, metabolomics studies conducted on human subjects between di- abetic patients and healthy controls revealed many important altered metabolic pathways and metabolic variations. Metabolomics increased our knowledge of the dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with progression of diseases and provided potentially new therapeutic strategies targeting these dysregulated pathways, though our under- standing about the distinct and complete metabolic footprints of T2D [32]. 4. Bringing metabolomics into T2D research Advantages of metabolomics over other “omics ”, include its high sensitivity and its ability to enable the analysis of relatively fewmetabolites compared with the unwieldy number of corresponding genes or mRNA molecules. There is mounting evidence that metabolo-mics can provide important insight into biomarker discoveries and the pathogenic nature of various diseases and a great deal of research on diabetes has been conducted with clinical human subjects during the last decade [33,34] . Given that the overall health status of an individual is captured by his or her metabolic state, metabolomics promises toimprove current, single metabolites-based clinical assessments by identifying metabolic signatures that embody global biochemical changes in disease. Metabolomic analytical platforms and informatics tools are being used to map potential biomarkers for T2D [35]. Application of metabolomics in T2D studies has rapidly evolved during the last decade and provides researchers the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pro ﬁling and pathophysiological mechanisms. Thus, several metabolites were identi ﬁed to be related to T2D or insulin resistance and represent the basis for the identi ﬁcation of novel diabetes biomarkers [36]. The accumulation of information ||| the last decade and provides researchers the opportunity to gain new insights into metabolic pro ﬁling and pathophysiological mechanisms. Thus, several metabolites were identi ﬁed to be related to T2D or insulin resistance and represent the basis for the identi ﬁcation of novel diabetes biomarkers [36]. The accumulation of information from novel metabolomics technologies comes with substantial hope and expectations that these approaches will yield novel insights into T2D disease processes and that these insights will eventually translate into clinical applications that will pave the way for current medical routine to the ideal of personalized medicine. High-de ﬁnition MS has been carried out to obtain comprehensive metabolite pro ﬁling and pathways of large biological data sets [7]. MS tends to have much higher analytical sensitivity, enables broader surveys of the metabolome, andcan be used to characterize metabolite data either in a targeted or nontargeted manner. Integration of metabolomics-based diagnostic principles into the T2D might be the direction to enable a revolution for future health care, also perhaps it is time to embrace the arrival of ‘T2D-OMICS ’era. 5. Biomarkers and metabolomics studies on T2D Identi ﬁcation of early biomarkers for prediction and monitoring is needed for adequate screening diagnostics of diabetes. A number of marker metabolites for diagnosis and prognosis of T2D have been reported. Metabolite pro ﬁles of body ﬂuids or tissues can be regarded as important indicators of physiological or pathological states, mayprovide a more comprehensive view of mechanisms in disease, and raise the possibility of identifying surrogate markers of T2D. Metabolomic discovery of biomarkers of T2D risk may reveal etiological pathways and help to identify individuals at risk. Floegel et al. had inves- tigated the association between serum metabolites measured by targeted metabolomics in the European cases of T2D [37]. MS used to quantify several metabolites, including acylcarnitines, amino acids,hexose, and phospholipids, in serum samples, signi ﬁcantly improvedT2D prediction. Surprisingly, metabolomics has revealed that branched- chain amino acids and related metabolites are more strongly associatedwith insulin resistance than many common lipid species [38].T h e branched-chain amino acids-related signature is predictive of incidentT2D and intervention outcomes and uniquely responsive to therapeutic interventions. Of note, Ha et al. reported that the receiver operating characteristic curve estimation suggested that decanoyl carnitine andlysoPC (C14:0) are the best metabolites for predicting the risk of developing T2D [39]. Phospholipids and their metabolisms are closely allied to nosogenesis and aggravation of T2D. Identi ﬁcation of molecular components of potential biomarkers was performed on ion trap-MS[40]. As a result, 18 compounds with signi ﬁcant regulation in patients compared with healthy controls were regarded as potential biomarkersfor T2D. Among them, 2 novel biomarkers, i.e., PI C18:0/22:6 and SM dC18:0/20:2, can be used to discriminate healthy individuals and T2D cases. Urinary metabolomes were analyzed to enhance understanding of the metabolic indicators of T2D disease pathogenesis and progression [41]. Urinary compounds signi ﬁcantly increased in the T2D when compared with the normal group including glycine betaine, citric acid,kynurenic acid, glucose, and pipecolic acid.

The general procedure in which metabolomics was used for diagnosisand biomarker discovery is shown in Fig. 1 . Metabolomics offers potential advantages that classic diagnose approaches do not, basedon following discovery of a suite clinically relevant biomarker that are simultaneously affected by the T2D [12,13] . It may help in understanding the mechanism of T2D occurrence and progression onthe metabolic level and providing information for the identi ﬁcation of early marker metabolites for T2D. Thus, in this mini-paper, particularattention will be paid to the past successes in applications of state-of- the-art technology on metabolomics to contribute to low-molecular- weight metabolites discovery in T2D research. 2. Metabolomics technologies Metabolomics has been increasingly applied to diagnosing diseases, measuring the response to treatment, discovering biomarkers, identify- ing perturbed pathways [14 –16]. Additionally, metabolomics can be seen as bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype, andidentifying novel changes in speci ﬁc metabolites. Technological developments are the driving force behind advances in scienti ﬁc knowledge. There are two major high-throughput tools consisting ofmass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy used in metabolomics study [17]. Both methods enable the comprehensive investigation of metabolic pro ﬁles and can provide complementary snapshots of the metabolome of body ﬂuids [18]. Ad- vantages of NMR spectroscopy include the nondestructive natureof the analysis, the robust and reproducible measurements and the minimal preparation requirements, as no separation or ionisation steps are necessary [19]. NMR analysis usually does not require anypretreatment, and enables the identi ﬁcation of complex unidenti ﬁed metabolites [20]. MS is the most frequently used technique in metabolic studies with their high level of sensitivity, and often combined with other suitable methods for the analytical separation of compounds [21,22] . Because no single analytical method can accommodate the chemical diversity of the entire metabolome, therefore, a multiplatform approach may provide a more comprehensive understanding ofmet abolic alterations, and broaden the “window ”of important metabolic variations [23,24] . 3. Metabolomic features of T2D T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function but currently it is dif ﬁcult to determine the precise pathophys- iology in T2D patients. Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is controlled by complex metabolic and energetic changes provoked by exposure to metabolic fuels. Perturbations in these processes lead to impaired insulin secretion, the ultimate cause of T2D. To increase our understanding of stimulus-secretion coupling and metabolic processes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of T2D, a comprehensive investigation of the metabolic response will be performed [25]. Metabolomics technologies have the potential for providing novelbiomarkers of disease and drug ef ﬁcacy, and are increasingly being incorporated into biomarker exploration studies [26]. More speci ﬁcally, metabolomics has a global and non-invasive analysis of biomarkers that are indicators of pathogenic process, or response to therapeutic intervention, thereby helping to monitor treatment response [27].

Despite its prevalence and the importance of early diagnosis, there is a lack of robustly validated biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease progression in response to a given treatment. In this Review, we provide an overview of the contribution of metabolomics and lipidomics in clinical studies to identify biomarkers associated with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In addition, we highlight the key metabolic pathways in NAFLD and NASH that have been identified by metabolomics and lipidomics approaches and could potentially be used as biomarkers for non-invasive diagnostic tests. Overall, the studies demonstrated alterations in amino acid metabolism and several aspects of lipid metabolism including circulating fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids and bile acids.

However, there is still a great demand to estab- lish and validate other biomarkers that predict NASH progression and/or response to treatment. Based on this demand, the Innovative Medicines Initiative Consortium ‘Liver Investigation: Testing Marker Utility in Steatohepatitis’ (IMI2 LITMUS) aims to develop, validate and advance towards qualification of biomarkers for testing NAFLD across a range of contexts of use. Different methodologies are consid- ered to be part of this aim, and metabolomics is one of these approaches. The metabolomics approach is a comprehensive biochemical profiling technique, built upon decades of fundamental research in biochemistry, physiology, analytical chemistry and bioinformatics. As the human plasma lipidome is enormously diverse and complex 14, lipidomics has emerged as a related subfield of metabolomics, aiming to comprehensively character - ize different molecular lipid species in biological systems as well as to investigate their function15. Metabolomics aims to assess metabolism and identify downstream functions of genes and proteins. The chemical and bio- logical diversity of the metabolome is enormous16. This diversity requires several analytical strategies, with an extensive array of techniques, to cover a wide range of metabolites while ensuring data output quality (Fig. 1). The advantages and limitations of different analytical approaches are summarized in TaBle 1.Genome-scale metabolic modelling has emerged as a powerful approach that can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of disease progression, and it has been used to attempt to identify biomarkers and underlying pathways for NAFLD–NASH 17–19. Genome- scale metabolic models (GSMMs), as a scaffold, connect metabolic genes and their products (that is, enzymes) with metabolic pathways. Moreover, GSMMs can be constrained and contextualized with multi-‘omics’ data - sets, thereby connecting an organism’s genotype to its phenotype. Using GSMMs one can study changes in the global metabolic network topology, evaluate metabolite flux distribution, and predict uptake and secretion of specific metabolites 20. In this Review, we evaluate the use of metabolomics and lipidomics, in clinical studies to identify biomark-ers associated with NAFLD and ||| for large numbers of gut microbial species 183. Application of genome-scale metabolic modelling on shotgun metagenomics data from stool samples can predict which metabolites are being produced in spe-cific diseases or physiological conditions 184. Such predic - tions can be validated by stool and serum metabolomics. Adding different layers of omics data is thus likely to lead to both improved sensitivity as well as specificity of NAFLD–NASH biomarkers. However, clinical vali-dation and translation of multimodal diagnostic tools might prove more challenging than only a single layer, both technologically as well as from the health econom-ics perspective. Nevertheless, adding multiple layers of data will enrich our knowledge about the complex pathophysiology of NAFLD–NASH and is expected to facilitate our search for biomarker candidates with the greatest sensitivity and specificity.

Although there are several reports on potential biomarkers, very few have been val- idated and used in the clinic, which is not unexpected, as different methods were applied in different populations. From an analytical perspective, the method of metab- olite or lipid identification and quantification in particu- lar might have a major effect on biomarker selection. In addition, some of the findings are based on relative differences in molecular biomarker concentrations, and it is not known whether this would be sufficient for diagnosis or prognosis of NASH. For diagnostic applications, as well as for the repro - ducibility of biomarker studies in general, it would be important to accurately quantify the metabolites, that is, by using appropriate internal standards, calibration and quality control, and using standard reference materials such as NIST-SRM 1950 (reF.177). Although quantifica- tion might not be practically possible in comprehensive screening studies covering hundreds or even thousands of metabolites, steps can already be taken to improve the accuracy of quantification, as, for example, recom - mended in the lipidomics community 177. Subsequent validation studies would need to further focus on metab- olite quantification, as this is the best way to assure the reliability of diagnostic signatures. Across different ana - lytical methods, relative concentrations of different metabolites measured might change if not accurately quantified. Additionally, for each biomarker, it would be essential to assess analytical variation with respect to normal, within-person variation. Moreover, the role of biomarker trajectories in individual patients was not assessed in most of the studies, which could be essential for understanding the long-term outcome of patients. In order to derive robust metabolic signatures of NAFLD–NASH, the reported biomarkers will need to be consolidated and validated. From an analytical perspective, this can be achieved, for example by har - monization of analytical approaches, including the use of similar methods of quantitation. While the discov- ery of metabolomics platforms with comprehensive metabolite coverage is important for the identification of putative disease biomarkers, further developments and validation of these biomarkers will require methods that can achieve accurate quantification of selected metabo- lites, thus assuring better interlaboratory and interstudy reproducibility. Current efforts to improve metabolomics and lipidomics workflows 177,178 are expected to improve our ability to effectively bridge the biomarker discovery stage, validation studies and translation to the clinic. Another area that is likely to lead to substantial advances in NASH biomarkers is investigation of mul- tiomics biomarkers179– 182. The gut microbiome is also a rich source of circulating metabolite biomarkers, as discussed in this Review and elsewhere148, 151, 152, 167. Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions are now available for large numbers of gut microbial species 183. Application of genome-scale metabolic modelling on shotgun metagenomics data from stool samples can predict which metabolites are being produced in spe-cific diseases or physiological conditions 184. Such predic - tions can be validated by stool and serum metabolomics. Adding different layers of ||| from reF.185, Springer Nature.

Impairment in amino acid metabolism in NAFLD is linked to insulin resistance and results in higher fasting concentrations of essential amino acids, as has also been observed in obesity. In patients with chronic liver disease, AAAs, in particular phenylalanine and its metabolite tyrosine, are frequently found to be decreased whereas BCAAs, especially leucine, isoleucine, valine and glutamate–glutamine are increased, mainly because of insulin resistance. However, as liver disease pro - gresses, the opposite is often observed, with high AAAs and reduced BCAAs, especially in patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency. In addition, a reduction in hepatic glutathione levels and elevation of methionine levels has been associated with liver damage and the progression of NAFLD to NASH. However, there is some inconsist- ency in the identified patterns and levels of reported amino acids in patients with NAFLD–NASH. This inconsistency is, in part, due to application of differ - ent metabolomics approaches, but also to the charac- terization of the clinical cohort (for example, different stage of NAFLD or different insulin resistance state). Our assessment further emphasizes the importance of implementing validated methods as well as identifying large well-characterized clinical cohorts. Another important observation is related to altera- tions in lipid metabolism. NASH is strongly associated with alterations in circulating fatty acid flux and intact lipids such as triglycerides and phospholipids, which is partially due to alterations in liver DNL, lipolysis rate and VLDL metabolism.
